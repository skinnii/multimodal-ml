1,Study of Virtual Reality Immersive Technology Enhanced Mathematics Geometry Learning,2022,3,"virtual reality technologies, mathematics learning aids, geometry education, immersive learning, emerging technologies",7,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Mathematics is an important foundation for the development of science education. In the past, when instructors taught mathematical concepts of geometry shapes, they usually used traditional textbooks and aids to conduct teaching activities, which resulted in students not being able to understand the principles completely. Nowadays, it has become a trend to integrate emerging technologies into mathematics courses and to use digital instructional aids. Emerging technologies can effectively enhance students' sensory experience while strengthening their impressions and understandings of subject concepts. In this paper, we apply virtual reality immersive technologies to develop a ""virtual reality immersive learning mathematics geometry system,"" which is used to teach mathematical geometry concepts. Teachers use the system to develop three basic mathematical geometry learning materials: ""Triangular pyramid volume = 1/3 prism volume,"" ""Cone volume calculation,"" and ""Triangle center of gravity derivation."" In the experimental activity, the teacher uses virtual reality teaching aids to guide students to learn mathematical geometry concepts in a fun way so that they can achieve the effectiveness of immersive learning. This study explores the impact of using the virtual reality immersive learning mathematics geometry system on students' technology acceptance, learning motivations, and learning performance. The experimental result showed that using the virtual reality immersive learning mathematics geometry system can improve the learning motivation and learning performance of students. The findings indicated that the experimental group had better learning outcomes after completing the learning tasks of three geometric units. The experimental group used the virtual reality immersive learning mathematics geometry system which can lead to better learning outcomes. According to the ARCS questionnaire, students in the experimental group were confident to understand new subjects. At the same time, the mode of completing the game can effectively give students a sense of accomplishment. The use of emerging technologies in the classroom can be an attractive learning mode for students.",Journal
2,Factors Influencing Nursing Students' Immersive Virtual Reality Media Technology-Based Learning,2021,2,virtual reality; learning; immersive media technology; teaching method; students,3,SENSORS,"Background/objectives: This study aims to identify the effects of cognitive and emotional variables related to immersive virtual reality media technology on learning for nursing students. Methods/Statistical analysis: The subjects of this study were 121 nursing students from a university in area D. After experiential learning with virtual reality from 6-8 June 2019, data was collected through questionnaires. For virtual reality learning, VIVE's hTC VIVE ECO CE model was used. The collected data was analyzed using the IBM SPSS 26.0 program. Multiple Regression Analysis was used to analyze the factors influencing the subject's virtual reality learning effects. Findings: The learning effects of the virtual reality medium had a statistically significant positive correlation with the virtual reality technology recognition, sensory immersion, realism, learning satisfaction, learning necessity, and continuous use intention (p < 0.001) scores. In personality traits, only Openness, Extraversion (p < 0.01), and Conscientiousness (p < 0.05) had a statistically significant positive correlation. As a result of regression analysis, the explanatory power of the learning effect of the virtual reality medium was 63.9% (F = 53.61, p < 0.001), with learning satisfaction, sensory immersion, continuous use intention, and Extraversion being significant influencing factors (p < 0.05). Improvements/Applications: This study is meaningful in the sense that it provided strategic implications for the teaching and learning method of virtual reality technology-based learning by considering the insights necessary to develop a learning program using virtual reality technology, according to the characteristics of virtual reality technology, and the learner's cognitive and psychological variables.",Journal
3,A Novel Immersive Anatomy Education System (Anat_Hub): Redefining Blended Learning for the Musculoskeletal System,2022,17,immersive technology; augmented reality; anatomy education; Anat_Hub; blended learning; learner engagement; self-regulated learning; active learning,2,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,"Immersive technologies are redefining ways of interacting with 3D objects and their environments. Moreover, efforts in blended learning have presented several advantages of incorporating educational technology into the learning space. The advances in educational technology have in turn helped to widen the choice of different pedagogies for improving learner engagement and levels of understanding. However, there is limited research in anatomy education that has considered the use and adoption of immersive technologies for the musculoskeletal system, despite its immense advantage. This research presents a practical immersive anatomy education system (coined Anat_Hub) developed using the agile scrum and participatory design method at a selected tertiary institution in Cape Town, South Africa, which promotes learner engagement through an asynchronous technological means using augmented reality (AR). The aim of the study was to develop an immersive AR mobile application that will assist learners and educators in studying and teaching the names, attachments, and actions of muscles of the human musculoskeletal system (upper and lower limbs). The Anat_Hub application offers a wide range of useful features for promoting active and self-regulated learning, such as 3D and AR modes, glossary, and quiz features. The application was tested with potential users, and on a variety of mobile device specifications. Very few volunteers have used AR prior to this study (13.2%). On a scale of 1 to 5, the majority of volunteers scored the application a 4 or 5. Overall, results and feedback obtained from users show that the proposed immersive anatomy system could effectively improve learner engagement and retention of anatomy concepts.",Journal
4,Digital Learning Across Boundaries (DLAB): Immersive technologies supporting changemaking in an international context,2021,4,Digital literacy; Changing society; Social dynamics; Social progress; Educational technology,3,RESEARCH IN EDUCATION AND LEARNING INNOVATION ARCHIVES-REALIA,"The Digital Learning Across Boundaries: Developing Changemakers (DLAB) project uses immersive technologies in education to explore three challenges across three years: physical, personal and environmental. This paper focuses on the first of these, bringing together the themes of digital making and changemaking to cross physical boundaries by raising awareness about physical inactivity in 11 and 12 year old school pupils. Immersive technologies such as augmented and virtual reality enabled the development of empathy and intercultural understanding among participants, fostered an understanding of changemaking, and created environments for sharing prototype exergames. Research data is analysed to seek evidence of the development of changemaker attributes and impact within a sample group of 60 English school pupils.",Journal
5,"Connecting Macroscopic, Molecular, and Symbolic Representations with Immersive Technologies in High School Chemistry: The Case of Redox Reactions",2022,3,high school/introductory chemistry; laboratory instructions; immersive technologies; electron transfer; nature of a redox reaction,0,EDUCATION SCIENCES,"Redox reaction is a difficult concept to teach and learn in chemistry courses at the secondary level. Although the significance of connecting macroscopic, molecular, and symbolic levels of representation has been emphasized in the chemistry education literature, most redox instruction involves only macroscopic and symbolic representations. To address this challenge, we designed a blended-reality immersive environment (BRE) model, which blends a traditional experiment with immersive technologies to make the molecular representations of redox reactions visible. The effectiveness of this model in supporting students' learning of redox reactions was first reported in a different article. In this paper, we further explore the features of BRE that drive learning gains. Results from six high school classes in the U.S. with 351 students indicate that integrating the molecular representation through adding the chemical bonds concept facilitates students in making connections between macroscopic and symbolic levels to promote learning. Dynamic demonstrations of electrons' interaction with particles support students' understanding of the nature of redox reactions. This study shows the promise of adopting immersive technologies to present all three representations of chemistry concepts in one learning model.",Journal
6,A Learning Experience in Inquiry-Based Physics with Immersive Virtual Reality: Student Perceptions and an Interaction Effect Between Conceptual Gains and Attitudinal Profiles,2021,3,Immersive virtual reality (VR) · Technology integration · Learning experience · Digital technologies attitudes · Scientific attitudes · Physics education,13,JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY,"The integration of immersive virtual reality (VR) in authentic science classrooms can result in a totally new learning experience for the students. However, the effect of such a learning experience on students' conceptual learning gains and their perceptions of the experience, while considering students' pre-existing science- and digital technologies-related attitudinal profiles, has not been explored to date. In this study, we have enacted a 90-min technology-enhanced inquiry-based intervention with high-school students (n = 107), on the topic of the Special Theory of Relativity in a Physics course, using a learning experience design, structured around an immersive VR simulation. Firstly, we aimed at examining students' attitudinal profiles and, secondly, at exploring the potential differences of those profiles in relation to conceptual learning gains and perceptions of the learning experience. A clustering analysis has revealed two attitudinal profiles: the low-attitudes profile (n = 48) included students with low science- and digital technologies-related attitudes, and the opposite for the high-attitudes profile (n = 59). Results from a 2 x 2 RM ANOVA indicated a statistically significant interaction between conceptual learning gains and attitudinal profiles. In addition, a one-way MANOVA test showed statistically significant differences between the two profiles in relation to students' perceptions of the learning experience, with the students of the high-attitude profile outperforming their counterparts. We discuss our findings, focusing on the implications of students' individual differences in learning and attitudes linked to the integration of immersive VR in inquiry-based instruction.",Journal
7,The Influence of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) on Skill Transfer of Learners: The Moderating Effects of Learning Engagement,2022,2,"Immersive virtual reality (IVR), moderating effect, skill transfer",1,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING,"Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is a full integration of virtual simulation and reality through computer engines and digital technologies. In particular, upon entering the field of education, IVR triggers the comprehensive reform of the education industry, realizes the interaction between virtual and real worlds, shapes a more highly immersive teaching scene, and meets the personalized needs of different learners. Thus, exploring the transfer of learning skills under IVR and traditional teaching modes is of great significance to understanding their causal relationship. Results show that training methods have significant differences in post-test scores. Immersive virtual experimental teaching plays a significant role in the skills transfer of learners, and learning engagement has a significant moderating effect in the above relationship. In this study, the results have important reference value for enriching the design of immersive teaching content, improving its design of translation, and promoting the skills transfer of learners to higher-order thinking knowledge.",Journal
8,Immersive Anatomy Atlas: Learning Factual Medical Knowledge in a Virtual Reality Environment,2022,7,gross anatomy education; anatomical atlas; virtual reality; immersive VR; active learning; knowledge retention,20,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,"In order to improve learning efficiency and memory retention in medical teaching, furthering active learning seems to be an effective alternative to classical teaching. One option to make active exploration of the subject matter possible is the use of virtual reality (VR) technology. The authors developed an immersive anatomy atlas which allows users to explore human anatomical structures interactively through virtual dissection. Thirty-two senior-class students from two German high schools with no prior formal medical training were separated into two groups and tasked with answering an anatomical questionnaire. One group used traditional anatomical textbooks and the other used the immersive virtual reality atlas. The time needed to answer the questions was measured. Several weeks later, the participants answered a similar questionnaire with different anatomical questions in order to test memory retention. The VR group took significantly less time to answer the questionnaire, and participants from the VR group had significantly better results over both tests. Based on the results of this study, VR learning seems to be more efficient and to have better long-term effects for the study of anatomy. The reason for that could lie in the VR environment's high immersion, and the possibility to freely and interactively explore a realistic representation of human anatomy. Immersive VR technology offers many possibilities for medical teaching and training, especially as a support for cadaver dissection courses.",Journal
9,Impacts of Cues on Learning and Attention in Immersive 360-Degree Video: An Eye-Tracking Study,2022,5,"immersive 360-degree video, signaling, cues, learning outcome, attention allocation, eye-tracking technologies",3,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Immersive 360-degree video has become a new learning resource because of its immersive sensory experience. This study examined the effects of textual and visual cues on learning and attention in immersive 360-degree video by using eye-tracking equipment integrated in a virtual reality head-mounted display. Participants (n = 110) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) no cues, (2) textual cues in the initial field of view (FOV), (3) textual cues outside the initial FOV, and (4) textual cues outside the initial FOV + visual cues. The results showed that the cues (annotations or annotations + arrows) helped learners achieve better learning outcomes and spend more time focusing on the areas with cues. In addition, the study found a serious imbalance in the distribution of learners' attention in each region of the video. The attention directed to textual cues in the initial FOV is much higher than the attention directed to textual cues outside the initial FOV. Adding visual cues can effectively direct attention to textual cues outside the initial FOV and alleviate the imbalance of attention distribution. Consequently, adding cues to immersive 360-degree video can be an appropriate approach to promote learning and guide attention in immersive 360-degree video learning environments. This study provided new insights into the design and development of immersive 360-degree video instructional resources.",Journal
10,A Spherical Video-Based Immersive Virtual Reality Learning System to Support Landscape Architecture Students' Learning Performance during the COVID-19 Era,2021,4,spherical video-based immersive virtual reality; landscape architecture education; landscape design; VR-based teaching–learning environments; immersive virtual environments; learning system; COVID-19,18,LAND,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, campuses are closed, and many schools are forced to transition to online instruction. There are many problems in landscape architecture education during the pandemic such as students' decreased attention, poor self-regulation, low proactivity, and difficulty in grading. In addition, situational effects are required for landscape architecture education, but online education lacks the necessary case scenarios for courses during the pandemic. In order to solve these problems, the present study adopted a more accessible, and interactive spherical video-based immersive virtual reality (SV-IVR) approach, developed a landscape architecture SV-IVR learning system, and conducted a quasi-experimental study to examine its effectiveness. The results indicated that the experimental group students showed more positive results in their learning achievements, learning attitudes, and self-regulation than the control group. Besides, it was found that students required more time to develop their self-efficacy and that this system would not have an effect on students' cognitive load.",Journal

Immersion has been identified as one of the driving forces that promote learning in technology-based learning environments. This study evaluated the learning effectiveness and immersion appeal of an AR-marker-based learning activity targeted at practicing basic chemistry concepts. Data were collected from a cohort of 124 middle school students in Mexico and analyzed using pretest-posttest comparisons and cluster analysis. The results suggest that students with higher immersive learning profiles achieve better learning outcomes compared with those with lower immersive profiles.,Journal
12,Application of Immersive Virtual Reality Interactive Technology in Art Design Teaching,2022,1,,0,COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE,"With the rapid development of economy and society, the integration of disciplines has become a key object faced by the whole society. The new characteristics of rapidly iterative technology and evolving theory of the digital age brought new challenges, especially for art and design teaching. At the same time, with the continuous progress of computer hardware level, all kinds of simulation technology constantly emerge, which also brought new opportunities for art design work. Art design teaching, as a systematic project, should use advanced teaching techniques with scientific theories. In the process of teaching design, how are all parts connected with each other, and what are the problems and needs of students and teachers? Through the analysis and research of these, we are aimed at finding ways and methods to solve these problems and needs, and to achieve the optimal teaching effect. The mode, technology, and methods of traditional art design teaching are getting more and more difficult to meet the needs of the society for comprehensive design art talents. Based on virtual reality technology and aimed at the art design teaching system, this paper studies the application of the immersive virtual reality technology in the design teaching practice. On the basis of the traditional design teaching mode, the integrated three-dimensional design teaching mode is put forward and verified. It can inspire students' creative inspiration in design teaching and guide them to immerse in learning and three-dimensional practice, constantly opening up creative thinking.",Journal

In particular, the Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) emerged as a promising approach leveraging the widespread availability of portable devices. In this study we investigated the feasibility and efficacy of a self-administered MALL homework training based on immersive 360 degrees videos, compared to a training based on not-immersive standard videos showing the same visual content and enriched by an auditory description of the environment. The knowledge of target words was assessed before and after the training. In addition, students' attitudes toward the technology were assessed before the training. Results indicated that students with a more positive attitude toward technology watched the videos more than those with a less positive attitude. Furthermore, students who underwent the training with 360 degrees videos learned more words than students belonging to the control group, even after controlling for the number of videos views.",Journal

A generalized experience of application of virtual reality technologies in distance learning of foreign languages is presented; the advantages, risks and deterrents of their introduction into the educational process in educational institutions are highlighted. The features by which technologies can be classified as virtual reality technologies are singled out. Examples of application of the following virtual reality technologies are considered: Mondly VR, VirtualSpeech, Immersive VR Education, AltspaceVR and ClassVR; their brief description, scenarios for use in learning foreign languages, benefits and risks of use are provided. Summarizing the review of these technologies, it was found that the educational content of distance learning of foreign languages through virtual reality can be divided into three groups: ""360-degree video"", platforms and sites, interactive programs. Conditions and didactic principles of the effective use of virtual reality technologies during distance learning of foreign languages are generalized. The issue of assessing effectiveness of virtual reality technologies in learning foreign languages is analyzed and identified as debatable and in need of further research. The criteria by which researchers summarize the principles of selection of evaluation criteria are clarified. Perspective directions of future scientific investigations are outlined: research of conditions of intensification and research of scenarios of use of collective intelligence during distance learning of foreign languages through virtual reality.",Journal
15,Immersive Virtual Reality Physical Education Instructional Patterns on the Foundation of Vision Sensor,2021,3,,4,JOURNAL OF SENSORS,"The creation of visual settings using avatar technology is the initial implementation of a voxel in the reporting context. This article is aimed at demonstrating the important role of a virtual reality immersive physical education model in current physical education and analyzing the immersive virtual reality physical education model. Relying on the mature VR virtual reality technology to establish a virtual simulation experiment platform, the application value in the education field is also reflected in the saving of experimental teaching costs. A complete set of VR teaching courseware also satisfies the functions of teaching training and assessment and is used repeatedly to maximize the value of utilization. This research mainly introduces the content of the optimization of the teaching method of the course combined with virtual reality technology. In order to make the data more convincing, reference literature and data in recent years have been referred to around immersive teaching. The first part is the discussion of immersive teaching, which includes the research of virtual immersive classroom teaching. The second part is a separate analysis of virtual reality technology. The third part is the practical exercise based on the first two parts; that is, from the learning effect and attitude of the student as the main body, the theoretical basis of the two parts on visual sensors and immersive virtual reality physical education teaching is transformed into real practice teaching. In the experiment part, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and support of immersive virtual teaching, on the one hand, we started with the teaching of teachers, and on the other hand, we carried out investigations from the aspects of students' learning. The desktop virtual environment teaching method is compared with the existing classroom teaching methods. The image processing and image analysis of the virtual reality technology are combined with the image gray level of the three-dimensional image to analyze the multitask algorithm of the vision sensor. The feasibility of immersive virtual teaching was verified. Research data shows that the 10 students participating in the experiment gave a score of 7.9 for the target attitude of immersive virtual reality physical education. Students' interest in learning will increase, and efficiency will also be greatly improved. VR can not only provide students with a new learning experience but also be used to strengthen teachers' teaching skills. Because VR can simulate a real teaching environment, teachers can use this set of tools to try new course materials and improve classroom management capabilities.",Journal
16,Developing student codesigned immersive virtual reality simulations for teaching of challenging concepts in molecular and cellular biology,2022,11,"virtual reality, molecular biology, cellular biology, immersive learning, virology",0,FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS,"Molecular biology theory represents a critical scaffold, which underpins multiple disciplines within life sciences education. However, it is well-documented that undergraduate students can struggle to achieve deeper understanding of key concepts and/or their application. One challenging, contributory aspect is the ""invisible"" nature of molecular biology processes compounded by critical 3D spatial orientations of the principal components and their interactions. Molecular theory specifically requires students to construct accurate, mental spatial models to develop their understanding. However, much of the traditional teaching and examination of such theory is limited to 2D representations. Technology-enhanced, complementary teaching and examination approaches, which engage students with spatial aspects of theoretical concepts, offer an exciting opportunity to support student learning in this area. In this study, we have explored the integration of an immersive virtual reality simulation based on a challenging molecular biology concept within an existing module taught at University College Cork. A mixed methods approach, grounded in learning theory, was undertaken to assess the student user and learning experience. The consensus response from students was one of enhanced learning, understanding, engagement, and motivation. Student partnership in the process of simulation design and integration was key to delivering the fully integrated experience.Student partnered design and cocreation of virtual reality simulations for teaching and learning in the molecular and cellular biology curriculum.",Journal
17,Shaping Children's Knowledge and Response to Bushfire Through Use of an Immersive Virtual Learning Environment,2022,3,"Bushfire safety, children, immersive virtual environments, problem-based learning, knowledge transfer, self-efficacy beliefs, gender differences",1,JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH,"A problem-based immersive virtual environment (IVE) about bushfire safety was developed as a learning tool for children aged 10-12. Its effectiveness was assessed in relation to children's ability to determine how to be safer in a bushfire incident. A series of experiential activities were developed in the IVE with digital storytelling and two-stage embedded assessments providing children with an opportunity to engage with tasks and solve problems while receiving feedback on their performance. Changes from pre- to postsurvey results showed positive learning outcomes as evidenced by significant improvements in children's knowledge of bushfire safety and confidence in their ability to contribute to decisions during a bushfire incident. The significant change in children's knowledge as well as their performance at two-stage embedded assessments was independent of their gender, background knowledge and perceived ability in responding to bushfire hazards. This suggests that when appropriately designed and implemented within educational settings, immersive virtual learning tools can effectively engage children and enhance learning outcomes associated with bushfire safety. The paper also argues that such immersive problem-based learning can improve self-efficacy amongst children in relation to coping with a bushfire situation. Implications of the findings are also discussed.",Journal
18,A Simulation Design of Immersive Virtual Reality for Animal Handling Training to Biomedical Sciences Undergraduates,2021,8,"immersive virtual reality, 4R principles, simulation, animal handling, biomedical research, undergraduate, teaching and learning",2,FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION,"Background: One area of biomedical research concerns is applying new treatments to cure human diseases, moving bench-side research to the bedside practice. While using animal models is crucial in the research process, researchers should strictly adhere to the moral 4R framework to protect animal welfare-replacement, reduction, refinement, and responsibility. Virtual reality (VR) applies computer technology to create a simulated environment, allowing players to immerse and interact with animated 3D contexts. We developed a virtual animal-holding simulator (ViSi) using immersive virtual reality technology for students studying in the undergraduate biomedical sciences programme. The specific objectives of the paper are to 1) describe the development of the VR courseware for animal training and 2) describe the learning experience among students. Method and Result: An evaluation of the courseware was conducted among Year one and two biomedical sciences students. Students who participated in ViSi responded positively about their involvement in the virtual environment experience and their concentration on the assigned task. Discussion: ViSi is a reliable simulation technology that can train animal handling skills, which replaces real animals, while learners' multi-cognition could still be enhanced with simulation training. Thus, the impact of immersive VR technology integrated into skills training is promising, although few technical problems are to be resolved.",Journal
19,Augmented Reality as a Sustainable Technology to Improve Academic Achievement in Students with and without Special Educational Needs,2020,3,inclusive education; academic achievement; augmented reality; sustainable technologies; knowledge retention; chemistry learning,26,SUSTAINABILITY,"Virtual reality has impacted education, where progressively more educational institutions consider its inclusion. The research problem derives from the need to study the educational possibilities provided by integrating augmented reality into the curriculum, and its effect on academic achievement in a diverse class, specifically in the chemistry subject. This study examines 60 school-age participants with and without special educational needs, and addresses three overarching questions: (a) Would integrating augmented reality (AR) technology result in better academic achievement? (b) Would knowledge be retained longer by using AR? (c) Is there any relationship between academic achievement, acceptance and motivation regarding the use of this technology? Embracing the socio-constructivist theory of learning and collaborative and immersive learning as a framework, this study was carried out using a quantitative approach and a pre-experimental design. The AR VR Molecules Editor application was used in chemistry lessons. Main results showed significant immediate academic achievement and content retention. Despite classroom diversity, immersive technologies enhance students' learning regardless of whether they have special educational needs (SEN) or not. They also acknowledge that AR is a suitable sustainable technology that may foster social and cognitive justice and inclusive education, and train students that are equally prepared for the dynamic future.",Journal

Specifically, augmented reality (AR) technology allows for immersive and experiential learning without the need to leave the classroom. The purposes of this paper were to apply AR technology in the training of future Primary Education teachers and to analyze the perceived usefulness of AR in the classroom by future teachers. A quantitative approach was used based on a design with a control group and two experimental groups with a post-test using a sample of 171 second-year students studying an education degree. The results showed that experimentation with AR promoted a slight increase in student motivation. However, no significant differences were found between the control group and the experimental groups. Finally, the findings allowed us to establish that the implementation of resources such as AR does not differ in the opinion of future teachers about the inclination to implement AR in the classroom.",Journal

22,Immersive virtual reality as a tool to learn problem-solving skills,2021,4,"Virtual reality, 21st century abilities, Problem-solving skills, Elementary Education Games",60,COMPUTERS & EDUCATION,"Immersive virtual reality (IVR) technology has demonstrated positive educational outcomes related to its use and is gaining traction in educational and training settings; IVR is expected to have widespread adoption within the classroom in the upcoming years. However, the educational potential of IVR with children has not been thoroughly investigated, especially as a tool for problem-solving skills. Therefore, this study was designed to answer the following questions: (1) Is IVR a useful tool to learn and practice problem-solving skills? More specifically, do children using IVR solve a game better than those using a tablet application or a board game? (2) Does IVR provide a more engaging experience for children to practice problem-solving skills than on a tablet or a board game? (3) Do problem-solving skills learned with IVR technology transfer to real-life (physical game)? Children (n = 120) aged 7-9.9 years were randomly assigned to a problem-solving game in one of three conditions: board game, tablet, or IVR. The results showed that, overall, the percentage of children who completed the problem-solving game was higher in the IVR condition (77.5%), compared with those in the tablet (32.5%) or board game (30%) conditions. We also found that the interest and enjoyment scores of participants using IVR were significantly higher than participants in the other two conditions, and that the children in the IVR condition were able to learn how to solve the problem and transfer their learning to the physical game. IVR is a technology capable of engaging interest and motivating the user, as well as having the potential to assist in cognitive processing and knowledge transfer.",Journal

We conducted a longitudinal study, in ecological settings, at an undergraduate field-course on three topics in environmental biology. Twenty-eight undergraduates were randomly assigned to either an iVR-interaction group or a video-viewing group. During the field-course, the iVR group interacted with a head-mounted device-based iVR simulation related to each topic (i.e. total three interventions), while the video group watched a pre-recorded video of the respective simulation on a laptop. Cognitive and affective data were collected through the following checkpoints: a pre-test before the first intervention, one topic-specific post-test immediately after each intervention, a final post-test towards the end of the course, and a longitudinal post-test deployed approximately 2 months after the course. Through a descriptive analysis, it was found that student performance on the knowledge tests increased considerably over time for the iVR group but remained unchanged for the video group. While no within- or between-group differences were noted for intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy measures, students in the iVR group enjoyed all the simulations, and perceived themselves to benefit from those simulations.",Journal

Visual attention Network analysis Eye-tracking",3,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,"Immersive virtual reality (IVR) provides great potential to experimentally investigate effects of peers on student learning in class and to strategically deploy virtual peer learners to improve learning. The present study examined how three social-related classroom configurations (i.e., students' position in the classroom, visuali-zation style of virtual avatars, and virtual classmates' performance-related behavior) affect students' visual attention toward information presented in the IVR classroom using a large-scale eye-tracking data set of N = 274 sixth graders. ANOVA results showed that the IVR configurations were systematically associated with differences in learners' visual attention on classmates or the instructional content and their overall gaze distribution in the IVR classroom (Cohen's d ranging from 0.28 to 2.04 for different IVR configurations and gaze features). Gaze-based attention on classmates was negatively related to students' interest in the IVR lesson (d = 0.28); specif-ically, the more boys were among the observed peers, the lower students' situational self-concept (d = 0.24).

25,A structural equation modeling investigation of the emotional value of immersive virtual reality in education,2018,2,Virtual reality · Emotions · Simulations · Presence · CVTAE · Structural equation modeling,310,ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,"Virtual reality (VR) is projected to play an important role in education by increasing student engagement and motivation. However, little is known about the impact and utility of immersive VR for administering e-learning tools, or the underlying mechanisms that impact learners' emotional processes while learning. This paper explores whether differences exist with regard to using either immersive or desktop VR to administer a virtual science learning simulation. We also investigate how the level of immersion impacts perceived learning outcomes using structural equation modeling. The sample consisted of 104 university students (39 females). Significantly higher scores were obtained on 11 of the 13 variables investigated using the immersive VR version of the simulation, with the largest differences occurring with regard to presence and motivation. Furthermore, we identified a model with two general paths by which immersion in VR impacts perceived learning outcomes. Specifically, we discovered an affective path in which immersion predicted presence and positive emotions, and a cognitive path in which immersion fostered a positive cognitive value of the task in line with the control value theory of achievement emotions.",Journal
26,Immersive 3D Experience of Osmosis Improves Learning Outcomes of First-Year Cell Biology Students,2021,3,,7,CBE-LIFE SCIENCES EDUCATION,"A Abstract biological processes that occur at the submicroscopic level, such as osmosis and diffusion, are inherently difficult for many students to conceptualize when traditional learning and teaching methods are used. This study introduced an immersive 320 degrees three-dimensional (3D) experience of osmosis in which students became engaged with the cellular environment in a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment. The aims of this study were: 1) to explore whether a textbook diagram of osmosis recreated as an immersive 3D learning experience would be a meaningful tutorial activity for first-year cell biology students at a regional Australian university; and 2) to gather preliminary evidence of the utility of the tutorial by examining student performance data. The experience was perceived by students to be fun, useful, and educational. Performance of all students improved on a multiple-choice exam question, with the percentage of students choosing the osmosis distractor answer decreasing from 26 to 15% (p < 0.001). Those students with moderate to high base-level knowledge also performed better on short-answer questions about the cell membrane and osmosis (10-14% better, depending on base-level knowledge, p < 0.001). We give recommendations for future studies to investigate using immersive visualization in science teaching.",Journal
27,Infusing Augmented Reality in Bilingual and ESL Education: Perceptions from Pre-service teachers,2021,,,,INNOEDUCA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION,"In recent years there has been an increased interest by Teacher Education programs to train its pre-service teachers with immersive technologies. This had led to a greater boom and exploration of teaching possibilities of these technologies, especially with augmented reality and its integration to the bilingual and ESL classroom. The following article presents a recent study that was conducted at Texas Woman's University with n=27 bilingual and ESL pre-service teachers. It served as a pilot and sought to determine pre-service teachers' perceptions on the strengths and limitations in the use of augmented reality for the bilingual and ESL classroom. It also sought to provide an understanding of potential mobile applications, educational implications and activities for the classroom. The study used a qualitative method following an exploratory design and integrated a content analysis. The findings indicated that the participants view AR as a strength to keep students engaged and motivated. On the other hand, access to AR technology was perceived as a limitation. The integration of AR applications such as Quiver and HP Reveal along with the integration of Culturally Relevant Teaching (Gay, 2013) supported the creation of activities (e.g., AR walls and class demonstrations) that were perceived by pre-service teacher candidates as possibilities to support learning in the bilingual and ESL classroom. The study also pointed out the need for more research on the topic.",Journal
28,Improved Complex Skill Acquisition by Immersive Virtual Reality Training A Randomized Controlled Trial,2020,4,,52,JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME,"Background: There has been limited literature on immersive virtual reality (VR) simulation in orthopaedic education. The purpose of this multicenter, blinded, randomized controlled trial was to determine the validity and efficacy of immersive VR training in orthopaedic resident education.Methods: Nineteen senior orthopaedic residents (resident group) and 7 consultant shoulder arthroplasty surgeons (expert group) participated in the trial comparing immersive VR with traditional learning using a technical journal article as a control. The examined task focused on achieving optimal glenoid exposure. Participants completed demographic qu`estionnaires, knowledge tests, and a glenoid exposure on fresh-frozen cadavers while being examined by blinded shoulder arthroplasty surgeons. Training superiority was determined by the outcome measures of the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) score, a developed laboratory metric, verbal answers, and time to task completion.Results: Immersive VR had greater realism and was superior in teaching glenoid exposure than the control (p = 0.01). The expert group outperformed the resident group on knowledge testing (p = 0.04). The immersive VR group completed the learning activity and knowledge tests significantly faster (p < 0.001) at a mean time (and standard deviation) of 11 +/- 3 minutes than the control group at 20 +/- 4 minutes, performing 3 to 5 VR repeats for a reduction in learning time of 570%. The immersive VR group completed the glenoid exposure significantly faster ( p = 0.04) at a mean time of 14 +/- 7 minutes than the control group at 21 +/- 6 minutes, with superior OSATS instrument handling scores (p = 0.03). The immersive VR group scored equivalently in surprise verbal scores (p = 0.85) and written knowledge scores (p = 1.0).Conclusions: Immersive VR demonstrated substantially improved translational technical and nontechnical skills acquisition over traditional learning in senior orthopaedic residents. Additionally, the results demonstrate the face, content, construct, and transfer validity for immersive VR.",Journal

The study focused on improvement of students' EFL abilities, intercultural communicative competence (ICC), and knowledge sharing (KS). A group of second-year students from China were partnered with a group of university students from Indonesia. 360-degree video technology was used to create an authentic and immersive intercultural learning environment in which students created content in English related to their culture and traditions, shared content with partners from the other culture, and reflected on their intercultural learning. We investigated whether learning activities supported by 360-degree video technology have positive impact on EFL learning, ICC development, and KS. The data was collected through questionnaires, tests, observations, and interviews. Three main findings were obtained in the study. The results demonstrated that 360-degree video technology-supported intercultural learning activities improved students' EFL abilities, ICC, and KS. In addition, it was found that dimensions of KS and ICC have significant relationship with each other. Finally, the students had a positive attitude toward the learning activities supported by 360-degree video technology, were satisfied with the technology, and had intentions to use it in the future for learning.

Potential applications are also the improvement of weak functions in the at-risk population (e.g., on children with neurodevelopmental disorders and children with language and communication disorders).Abstract Virtual reality (VR) creates computer-generated virtual environments where users can experience and interact in a similar way as they would do in real life. VR systems are increasingly being used for rehabilitation goals, mainly with adults, but also with children, extending their application to the educational field. This report concerns a study of the impact of a semi-immersive VR system in a group of 25 children in a kindergarten context. The children were involved in several different games and activity types, specifically developed with the aim of learning specific skills and foster team collaboration. Their reactions and behaviors were recorded by their teachers and by trained psychologists through observation grids addressing task comprehension, participation and enjoyment, interaction and cooperation, conflict, strategic behaviors, and adult-directed questions concerning the activity, the device or general help requests. The grids were compiled at the initial, intermediate and final timepoint during each session. The results show that the activities are easy to understand, enjoyable, and stimulate strategic behaviors, interaction and cooperation, while they do not elicit the need for many explanations. These results are discussed within a neuroconstructivist educational framework and the suitability of semi-immersive, virtual-reality-based activities for cognitive empowerment and rehabilitation purposes is discussed.",Journal
31,An immersive virtual reality serious game to enhance earthquake behavioral responses and post-earthquake evacuation preparedness in buildings,2020,8,,55,ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,"Enhancing the earthquake behavioral responses and post-earthquake evacuation preparedness of building occupants is beneficial to increasing their chances of survival and reducing casualties after the mainshock of an earthquake. Traditionally, training approaches such as seminars, posters, videos or drills are applied to enhance preparedness. However, they are not highly engaging and have limited sensory capabilities to mimic life-threatening scenarios for the purpose of training potential participants. Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) and Serious Games (SG) as innovative digital technologies can be used to create training tools to overcome these limitations. In this study, we propose an IVR SG-based training system to improve earthquake behavioral responses and post-earthquake evacuation preparedness. Auckland City Hospital was chosen as a case study to test our IVR SG training system. A set of training objectives based on best evacuation practice has been identified and embedded into several training scenarios of the IVR SG. Hospital staff (healthcare and administrative professionals) and visitors were recruited as participants to be exposed to these training scenarios. Participants' preparedness has been measured along two dimensions: 1) Knowledge about best evacuation practice; 2) Self-efficacy in dealing with earthquake emergencies. Assessment results showed that there was a significant knowledge and self-efficacy increase after the training. In addition, participants acknowledged that it was easy, helpful, and engaging to learn best evacuation practice knowledge through the IVR SG training system.",Journal

This is especially true for early-career medical personnel. Training providers to respond effectively to medical emergencies before being confronted with a real scenario is limited by unnatural or high-cost training modalities that fail to realistically replicate the stress and gravity of real-world trauma management. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) may provide a unique training solution.MethodsWe created a working group of 10 active duty or former military emergency medicine physicians and two technical experts. We hosted 10 meetings to facilitate the development process. The program was developed with financial support from the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC), through the primary vendor Exonicus, Inc, with support from Anatomy Next Inc, and Kitware, Inc. Development was completed using an agile project management style, which allowed our team to review progress and provide immediate feedback on previous milestones throughout its completion. The working group completed the resulting four simulation scenarios to evaluate perceived realism and training potential. Finally, testing of the technology platform off the network in a deployed role 3 was conducted.ResultsUpon completion, we created four IVR scenarios based on the highest mortality battlefield injuries: hemorrhage, tension pneumothorax, and airway obstruction. The working group unanimously indicated a high level of realism and potential training usefulness. Throughout this process, there have been a number of lessons learned and we present those here to show what we have created as well as provide guidance to others creating IVR training solutions.ConclusionOur team developed trauma scenarios that, to our knowledge, are the only IVR trauma scenarios to run autonomously without instructor input. Furthermore, we provide a potential template for the creation of future autonomous IVR training programs. This framework may offer a dynamic starting point as more teams seek to leverage the capabilities IVR offers.",Journal
33,Immersive virtual reality in STEM: is IVR an effective learning medium and does adding self-explanation after a lesson improve learning outcomes?,2022,5,,0,ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,"The goal of the current study was to investigate the effects of an immersive virtual reality (IVR) science simulation on learning in a higher educational setting, and to assess whether using self-explanation has benefits for knowledge gain. A sample of 79 undergraduate biology students (40 females, 37 males, 2 non-binary) learned about next-generation sequencing using an IVR simulation that lasted approximately 45 min. Students were randomly assigned to one of two instructional conditions: self-explanation (n = 41) or control (n = 38). The self-explanation group engaged in a 10 min written self-explanation task after the IVR biology lesson, while the control group rested. The results revealed that the IVR simulation led to a significant increase in knowledge from the pre- to post-test (ss(Posterior) = 3.29). There were no differences between the self-explanation and control groups on knowledge gain, procedural, or conceptual transfer. Finally, the results indicate that the self-explanation group reported significantly higher intrinsic cognitive load (ss(Posterior) = .35), and extraneous cognitive load (ss(Posterior) = .37), and significantly lower germane load (ss(Posterior) = - .38) than the control group. The results suggest that the IVR lesson was effective for learning, but adding a written self-explanation task did not increase learning after a long IVR lesson.",Journal

This study wasn't a bound course with mandatory participation, and students were free to participate in the trial, and employed HTC VIVE, which provides highly immersive experiences, to elicit strong emotional responses. A total of 111 students from a university digital media department were invited to participate in a 3D VR painting experiment in which students created paintings using Google Tilt Brush. A 5-point scale based on the ARCS learning motivation model was adopted to collect student data. Perform a factor analysis of the data twice to select the appropriate factor (p = 0.000 < 0.05). Specifically, exploratory factor analysis was used to classify factors based on four constructs. The Cronbach alpha values of ARCS were 0.920, 0.929, 0.693 and 0.664, respectively, both >0.6, which still indicate favorable reliability. The results show that immersive VR can promote students' motivation and interest in learning 3D animation.

Nevertheless, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are particularly useful to encourage active and autonomous learning, normally associated with deeper levels of engagement and understanding of the subjects taught. In this way, several studies have demonstrated that immersion has the potential to increase learning experiences and improve creativity and engagement, Virtual Reality (VR) being a remarkable example. In this context, we created and shared with students two immersive resources based on VR: (a) a laboratory 360 degrees video tour, which was used to disseminate the Chemical Engineering Degree in an Open Door Days organized for high school students; and (b) an experiential learning tool integrated with Moodle, which was available previously to face-to-face practical lessons of the subject Separation Operations. In both cases, the feedback from the participant students was positive. High school students increased their interest in Chemical Engineering Degree after viewing the 360 degrees video, meanwhile undergraduate students found the immersive tool useful in the subsequent performance of real practical activities. From the perspective of professors, creation of these resources required purchase of equipment, time and effort, but they were highly valued as a tool for disseminating and supporting teaching, being an initial starting point for the creation of more enhanced VR-based materials.",Journal

We assessed spatial knowledge acquisition in male and female participants using a technology not previously examined empirically: the digital fulldome. Our primary aim was to examine whether performance on a test of survey knowledge was better in a fulldome (N = 28, 12 males) relative to a large, flat screen display (N = 27, 13 males). Regression analysis showed that, compared to a flat screen display, males showed higher levels of performance on a test of survey knowledge after learning in the fulldome, but no benefit occurred for females. Furthermore, performance correlated with spatial visualization ability in male participants, but not in female participants. Thus, the digital fulldome is a potentially useful learning aid, capable of accommodating multiple users, but individual differences and use of strategy need to be considered.",Journal

Science classes, in particular, stand to lose substantial learning opportunities without the ability to provide physical laboratory experiences. Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to resolve this issue, but little is known if VR environments can produce similar results to real-life (RL) science learning environments. This 2 x 1, between-subjects study compares students' learning results and safety behaviors in VR and RL chemistry laboratories. The study attempts to identify differences in learning experience (i.e., general chemistry content, experiment comprehension, laboratory safety knowledge) and laboratory safety behavior. Results indicate learning general content knowledge, laboratory skills, and procedure-related safety behaviors were comparable between RL and VR conditions, but clean-up behaviors were less frequent in VR. Also, the exploratory, risk-free nature of VR environments may have allowed the learners to elaborate and reflect more on general chemistry content and laboratory safety knowledge than in the RL environment.",Journal

This paper aims to assess the impact of virtual reality simulation (VR-SBL) on student learning and satisfaction. To this end, two cases are presented that have been carried out at Universidad Europea de Madrid (UEM): the first consists of training experience to provide first aid in the event of a traffic emergency through the use of immersive virtual reality technology, where a comparison has been made between how students learn with this new methodology concerning the traditional master class. The second case is the simulation of accidents in a laboratory using virtual reality desktop technology, where a comparison has been made between how students learn with this methodology for simulation of such accidents in the real laboratory. In both cases, a quasi-experimental design with an experimental group and a control group has been used. Also, a pretest-posttest design has been applied, consisting of a knowledge test before the experience (pretest) and a knowledge questionnaire after the experience (posttest). To measure satisfaction with the activity and the adequacy of the tools used, a user experience questionnaire was administered. In conclusion, student satisfaction was high in both cases. Besides, in the first case, the experimental group using immersive virtual reality had a significantly better academic performance. As for the second case, no significant differences were found in terms of learning. Therefore, the level of learning in both groups (virtual reality simulation and real scenario simulation) was the same.",Journal

This study used the virtual reality (VR) technology to develop a virtual ecological environment for learning about the Taipei tree frog, supported by situated learning and game-based learning design to enhance students' learning interest and motivation. Users can wear the head-mounted display (HMD) to explore the virtual environment for learning the Taipei tree frog's ecological behavior, such as foraging and mating as well as its habitats and predators. A teaching experiment was conducted to investigate students' learning effectiveness and the senses of presence and anxiety after using the virtual ecological environment. The experimental group (wearing the HMD) contained 40 students, the control group (using the desktop VR) contained 40 students, and both groups were used as samples to learn about the Taipei tree frog. The results indicated that using HMD VR and desktop VR could both enhance learning achievements, but the learning effectiveness of the former was significantly higher than that of the latter. The levels of anxiety for both groups were about the same, but the level of presence for the experimental group was higher than that of the control group because the HMD VR provided a more immersive experience than the desktop VR. The virtual ecological environment can save the time and effort of travelling to the natural habitat for observing the Taipei tree frog, and the design of role-playing game (RPG) can enhance learners' interest and motivation.

In the classroom, teachers occupy most of the time, students only passively receive a lot of information from teachers, they have little chance to participate in the exchange of information and express ideas in the target language, and most of the time they are ""immersed"" in the Chinese environment. The overall English level was also better than that of the control class, with an average score of 2.8 points higher. This shows that college English immersive context teaching combining constructivism theory and VR technology can indeed improve students' English level.",Journal
51,Use of augmented reality (AR) to aid bioscience education and enrich student experience,2021,7,augmented reality; structural biology; protein structure; biomedical science; biosciences; education; engagement,10,RESEARCH IN LEARNING TECHNOLOGY,"In recent years, development of new technologies designed to enhance user experience have accelerated, often being used in modern media such as in films and games. Specifically, immersive experiences, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), have redefined how digital media can be delivered, encouraging us to interact with and explore our environment. Reciprocally, as the power of these technologies has advanced, the associated costs to implement them have decreased, making them more cost-effective and feasible to deliver in a variety of settings. Despite the cost reduction, several issues remain with accessibility due to the knowledge base required to generate, optimise and deliver three-dimensional (3D)-digital content in both AR and VR. Here, we sought to integrate an AR-based experience into a level-4 biochemistry module in order to support the delivery of university lectures on protein structure and function. Traditionally, this topic would comprise two-dimensional still images of complex 3D structures. By combining a breadth of subject-specific and technological expertise from across the university, we developed an AR-enhanced learning experience hosted on the Zapworks AR platform. AR enabled full illustration of the complexity of these 3D structures, while promoting collaboration through a shared user experience. Assessing the impact of the AR experience via a formative test and survey revealed that despite only a modest increase in test performance, students overwhelmingly reported positively on the engaging nature and interactivity of AR. Critically, expanding our repertoire of content delivery formats will support the forward-thinking blended learning environments adopted across the higher education sector.",Journal

In this study, an immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual radiography simulation tool was piloted in an undergraduate Radiography curriculum and user feedback retrieved.Methods: The 3D virtual simulation tool by Virtual Medical Coaching Ltd was introduced to first year radiography students (n = 105). This technology guided students through a comprehensive process of learning anatomy, radiographic positioning and pathology. Students then X-rayed a virtual patient in the VR suite using HTC Vive Pro (TM) headsets and hand controllers. Instant feedback was provided. An online survey was later disseminated to students to gather user feedback. Thematic and descriptive statistical analyses were applied.Results: A response rate of 79% (n = 83) was achieved. Most respondents (58%) reported enjoying VR simulation, whilst some felt indifferent towards it (27%). Ninety-four percent would recommend this tool to other students. The mean length of time it took for students to feel comfortable using the technology was 60 min (10-240 min). Most respondents (58%) desired more VR access. Students attributed enhanced confidence in the areas of beam collimation (75%), anatomical marker placement (63%), centring of the X-ray tube (64%) and exposure parameter selection (56%) to their VR practice. Many students (55%) advocated the use of VR in formative or low stakes assessments. Issues flagged included technical glitches, inability to palpate patient and lack of constructive feedback.Conclusion: Student feedback indicates that 3D virtual radiography simulation is a valuable pedagogical tool in radiography educationImplications for practice: 3D immersive VR simulation is perceived by radiography students to be a valuable learning resource. VR needs to be strategically implemented into curricula to maximise its benefits. (C) 2020 The College of Radiographers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Journal

56,Influence of Learning Engagement on Learning Effect under a Virtual Reality (VR) Environment,2022,1,"virtual reality (VR), learning engagement, learning effect, mediating effect",1,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING,"In this study, the differences generated by the scenario resources under a virtual reality (VR) environment to the learning effect and learning engagement were explored. Next, the influences of learning engagement (including emotional engagement and cognitive engagement) on the immediate test performance and the one-week-later test performance were tested. Finally, the mediating role played by the VR technology in the facilitating effect of learning engagement on the learning effect was analyzed. Results reveal that the emotional engagement (3.366) and cognitive engagement (3.854) in the experimental group under the VR environment are higher than those (3.325 and 3.618, respectively) in the control group. The difference between the control group and experimental group in the aspect of immediate test performance is significant at the 0.01 level (t=-3.388, p=0.002), and the same significance level is manifested in the aspect of one-week-later test performance (t=-3.126, p=0.003). Whether VR-based teaching was adopted plays a complete mediating role in the influences of cognitive engagement on the immediate test performance and the one-week-later test performance, but it does not play any mediating role in the influences of emotional engagement on the immediate test performance and the one-week-later test performance. The conclusions have important reference values for giving full play to VR-based teaching design, encouraging front-line teachers to participate in customizing VR-based immersive teaching resources, optimizing the VR learning contents highlighting emotional elements, and designing multichannel perceived knowledge contexts.",Journal

To address these concerns, related literature suggests technology usages with a blend of digital and physical learning experiences. Towards this end, we developed Kid Space, incorporating immersive computing experiences designed to engage children more actively in physical movement and social collaboration during play-based learning. The technology features an animated peer learner, Oscar, who aims to understand and respond to children's actions and utterances using extensive multimodal sensing and sensemaking technologies. To investigate student engagement during Kid Space learning experiences, an exploratory case study was designed using a formative research method with eight first-grade students. Multimodal data (audio and video) along with observational, interview, and questionnaire data were collected and analyzed. The results show that the students demonstrated high levels of engagement, less attention focused on the screen (projected wall), and more physical activity. In addition to these promising results, the study also enabled us to understand actionable insights to improve Kid Space for future deployments (e.g., the need for real-time personalization). We plan to incorporate the lessons learned from this preliminary study and deploy Kid Space with real-time personalization features for longer periods with more students.",Journal

However, despite the increasing interest, there remains a lack of robust empirical evidence to justify the mainstream acceptance of this approach as an effective and efficient learning tool. In this study, the impact of a mixed reality application focused on long spinal cord sensory and motor pathways is explored in comparison to an existing resource already embedded within an active curriculum (e.g., anatomy drawing screencasts). To assess the changes in learner gain, a quasi-randomized control trial with a pre- and post-test methodology was used on a cohort of Year 2 medical students, with both the absolute and normalized gain calculated. Similar patterns of learner gain were observed between the two groups; only the multiple-choice questionnaires were shown to be answered significantly higher with the screencast group. This study adds important empirical data to the emerging field of immersive technologies and the specific impact on short-term knowledge gain for neuroanatomy teaching, specifically that of long sensory and motor pathways. Despite the limitations of the study, it provides important additional data to the field and intends to support colleagues across the education landscape in making evidence-informed decisions about the value of including such resources into their curricula.",Journal
59,Learning My Way: A Pilot Study of Navigation Skills in Cerebral Palsy in Immersive Virtual Reality,2020,7,,7,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Purpose: Human navigation skills are essential for everyday life and rely on several cognitive abilities, among which visual-spatial competences that are impaired in subjects with cerebral palsy (CP). In this work, we proposed navigation tasks in immersive virtual reality (IVR) to 15 children with CP and 13 typically developing (TD) peers in order to assess the individual navigation strategies and their modifiability in a situation resembling real life.Methods: We developed and adapted to IVR an application based on a 5-way maze in a playground that was to be navigated to find a reward. The learning process, navigation strategies, and adaptation to changes were compared between participants with CP and their TD peers and correlated with visual-spatial abilities and cognitive competences.Results: Most participants with CP needed more attempts than TD participants to become proficient in navigation. Furthermore, the learning phase was correlated to visual-spatial memory but not with cognitive competences. Interestingly, navigation skills were comparable between groups after stabilization. While TD participants mainly relied on allocentric strategies based on environmental cues, egocentric (self-centered) strategies based on body motion prevailed in participants with CP. Furthermore, participants with CP had more difficulties in modifying their navigation strategies, caused by difficulties in executive processes beyond the visual-perceptual impairment, with an inefficient shift between implicit and explicit competences.Conclusions: The navigation abilities in participants with CP seem to be different from their TD peers in terms of learning and adaptation to new conditions; this could deeply affect their everyday life and ultimately participation and inclusion.

Although AR and VR technologies have been widely utilized in the educational domain, there remains a dearth of empirical research examining the differences in educational impact across AR and VR technologies. The purpose of our exploratory study was to address this gap in the literature by comparing AR and VR technologies with regard to their impact on learning outcomes, such as retention of science information. Specifically, we use a two-condition (AR vs. VR) between-subjects' design to test college students' science-knowledge retention in response to both auditory and visual information presented on a Samsung S4 smartphone app. Our results (N = 109) suggest that VR is more immersive and engaging through the mechanism of spatial presence. However, AR seems to be a more effective medium for conveying auditory information through the pathway of spatial presence, possibly because of increased cognitive demands associated with immersive experiences. Thus, an important implication for design is that educational content should be integrated into visual modalities when the experience will be consumed in VR, but into auditory modalities when it will be consumed in AR.",Journal

Providing a shared control/view may improve the task performance and enhance the user experience during VR collaboration.[Objectives] Therefore, this research explores the effect of collaborative modes and user position arrangements on task performance, user engagement, and collaboration behaviors and patterns in a VR learning environment that supports immersive collaborative tasks.[Method] The study involved two collaborative modes (shared and non-shared view and control) and three position arrangements (side-by-side, corner-to-corner, and back-to-back). A user study was conducted with 30 participants divided into three groups (Single, Shared, and Non-Shared) using a VR application that allowed users to explore the structural and transformational properties of 3D geometric shapes.[Results] The results showed that the shared mode would lead to higher task performance than single users for learning analytics tasks in VR. Besides, the side-by-side position got a higher score and more favor for enhancing the collaborative experience.[Conclusion] The shared view would be more suitable for improving task performance in collaborative VR. In addition, the side-by-side position may provide a higher user experience when collaborating in learning VR. From these results, a set of guidelines for the design of collaborative visualizations for VR environments are distilled and presented at the end of the paper. All in all, although our experiment is based on a colocated setting with two users, the results are applicable to both colocated and distributed collaborative scenarios with two or more users.",Journal

Two versions of IFOREAL, each employing different devices, were developed. The consumer version uses a traditional LCD display and computer mouse, whereas the professional version utilizes a head-mounted display (HMD) and joystick controller for the virtual learning. Trainees watched simulated videos and interacted with the system to accomplish tasks. IFOREAL consists of several major learning modules of gynecology. This study used the normal spontaneous delivery module to research user experience and perceptions of the IFOREAL VR training system. The results suggested that most of the trainee's user experiences and perceptions of IFOREAL, using both the types of VR-assisted technology, were positively reported. Trainees who used the consumer version of IFOREAL perceived a stronger internal control, whereas trainees using the professional version perceived a better sense of virtual presence. Overall, trainees perceived the usefulness of the IFOREAL system which predicted their future intention to use the system and other similar VR-assisted training systems for learning. Furthermore, whether the virtual content of IFOREAL grabbed the trainees' attention predicted their future intenon to use professional devices of HMD/joysck for learning other subjects. The gender difference was also explored in the study. Generally speaking, female trainees gave better evaluations of IFOREAL compared to their male counterparts. They perceived a better internal control while using the consumer version than the professional version. Male trainees believed that the gadgets used in the professional version provided a better virtual presence and met their expectation of a virtual experience better.

67,Learning History Using Virtual and Augmented Reality,2021,3,virtual reality; augmented reality; playful experience; education; history,3,COMPUTERS,"Master lectures of history are usually quite boring for the students, and to keep their attention requires a great effort from teachers. Virtual and Augmented Reality have a clear potential in education and can solve this problem. Serious games that use immersive technologies allow students to visit and interact with environments dated in different ages. Taking this in mind, this article presents a playful virtual reality experience set in Ancient Rome that allows the user to learn concepts from that age. The virtual experience reproduces as accurately as possible the different buildings and civil constructions of the time, making it possible for the player to create Roman cities in a simple way. Once built, the user can visit them, accessing the buildings and being able to interact with the objects and characters that appear. Moreover, in order to learn more information about every building, users can visualize them using Augmented Reality using marker-based techniques. Different information has been included related to every building, such as their main uses, characteristics, or even some images that represent them. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed experience, several experiments have been carried out, taking as sample Secondary School students. Initially, the game's quality and playability has been evaluated and, subsequently, the motivation of the virtual learning experience in history. The results obtained support on the one hand its gameplay and attractiveness, and on the other, the student's increased interest in studying history, as well as the greater fixation of different concepts treated in a playful experience.",Journal

Ninety-three participants distributed in four conditions took part in the experiment. The four conditions manipulated the collective and individual dimensions of the learning environment as well as the high and low immersion of the learning material. The two conditions that offered a high immersion setting used two types of the novel immersive dome: a large one for collective immersion and a small one for individual use. All participants were presented with the same stimuli, an 8-min-long video of a virtual neighbourhood visit in Paris in the 18th century.

Augmented reality has also evolved as a ubiquitous, robust, and effective technology for providing innovative educational tools. In engineering education, many abstract concepts require technological intervention for conceptual understanding and better instructional content. While learning through the immersive tools, system usability has great importance in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Effectiveness refers to users' accuracy and completeness in achieving defined goals; efficiency relates to expended resources about the precision and completeness with which users achieve their objectives; satisfaction deals with a positive attitude towards using the product. If the system fails to provide good usability, it may cause adverse effects such as increasing stress, lacking necessary features, increasing the users' cognitive load, and negatively impacting the student's motivation. In this study, two mobile augmented reality (MAR) applications were developed as an instructional tool to teach the students about Karnaugh maps in the digital electronics course. The first application is a Keypad-based MAR application that uses a keypad matrix for user interaction and the second application is a Marker-based MAR application that uses multiple markers to solve K-Map for producing an optimum solution of the given problem. An experimental study was conducted to determine the student's opinion of the developed MAR applications. The study was designed to determine the system usability of the two MAR applications using the System Usability Score (SUS) and Handheld Augmented Reality Usability Score (HARUS) models. 90 engineering students participated in the study, and they were randomly divided into two different groups: keypad-based group and Marker-based group. The keypad-based group included 47 students who had hands-on experience with a keypad-based MAR application, whereas the marker-based group included 43 students who had hands-on experience with multiple marker-based MAR applications. The experimental outcomes indicated that the keypad-based MAR application has better SUS and HARUS scores than the marker-based MAR application which suggests that the keypad-based MAR application has provided better user interaction.",Journal
70,Physics holo.lab learning experience: using smartglasses for augmented reality labwork to foster the concepts of heat conduction,2018,8,"augmented reality, multiple representations, learning environments",72,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS,"Fundamental concepts of thermodynamics rely on abstract physical quantities such as energy, heat and entropy, which play an important role in the process of interpreting thermal phenomena and statistical mechanics. However, these quantities are not covered by human visual perception, and since heat sensation is purely qualitative and easy to deceive, an intuitive understanding often is lacking. Today immersive technologies like head-mounted displays of the newest generation, especially HoloLens, allow for high-quality augmented reality learning experiences, which can overcome this gap in human perception by presenting different representations of otherwise invisible quantities directly in the field of view of the user on the experimental apparatus, which simultaneously avoids a split-attention effect. In a mixed reality (MR) scenario as presented in this paper-which we call a holo.lab-human perception can be extended to the thermal regime by presenting false-color representations of the temperature of objects as a virtual augmentation directly on the real object itself in real-time. Direct feedback to experimental actions of the users in the form of different representations allows for immediate comparison to theoretical principles and predictions and therefore is supposed to intensify the theory-experiment interactions and to increase students' conceptual understanding. We tested this technology for an experiment on thermal conduction of metals in the framework of undergraduate laboratories. A pilot study with treatment and control groups (N = 59) showed a small positive effect of MR on students' performance measured with a standardized concept test for thermodynamics, pointing to an improvement of the understanding of the underlying physical concepts. These findings indicate that complex experiments could benefit even more from augmentation. This motivates us to enrich further experiments with MR.",Journal

The use of augmented reality (AR) under visuospatial bootstrapping (VSB), a novel approach developed from work on the cognitive psychology of working memory, was contrasted with an established application, Quizlet that has been extensively used in foreign-language teaching. The AR-VSB technique offered superior vocabulary learning compared with the Quizlet method in delayed post-tests, although statistical data indicate a somewhat higher forgetting rate after a week in the AR-VSB method. Even so, the experimental technique still offers superior retention compared with the method used in the control group and could be used as an effective initial input method for acquiring vocabulary items in second-language learning. The main novel conclusionin this research has been that the integration of immersive AR experiences into familiar physical space has been seen to improve vocabulary recall test performance among a sample of twenty-first-century university students attempting to learn a second language. The evidence gathered from the experiment can have future practical applications and might contribute to immersive educational technology and innovative material development in second-language instruction.",Journal
72,A realist evaluation of student use of a virtual reality smartphone application in undergraduate legal education,2020,2,"CMO framework, legal education, theory-driven/realist evaluation, virtual reality",48,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,"This paper provides a realist evaluation of the Open Justice virtual reality (VR) smartphone app, designed to develop presentation skills for students on an undergraduate legal education module. This work addresses two research questions: what proportion of students engaged with the Open Justice app, and what worked for whom in what circumstances and why? Questionnaire and interviews were conducted and analysed using a realist evaluation approach. This approach is particularly pertinent to the evaluation of how emerging educational technologies are used, as it can point to the potential affordances of a technological intervention, in addition to assessing its current use. In keeping with the realist evaluation approach, data analysis was completed using the context-mechanism-outcome framework. The findings suggest that more than half of students did not engage with the app during their studies, but this was not surprising as it was a pilot project into using VR with our students and such innovations can be difficult to manage in distance education contexts. Those who did engage with it recognised the potential of immersive VR to contribute to legal skills development, but they found the application of the technology, in this context, to be of limited use. By utilising a realist evaluation framework, this study contributes to the emerging field of programme theory-based evaluations of educational technology, which might form the basis of further research. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Smartphone-based virtual reality technology has developed exponentially and is now widely and cheaply available. Smartphone-based virtual reality technology has the potential to develop professional skills, and thereby provide a useful addition to experiential learning pedagogies. This is of particular relevance to the development of professional legal skills in the context of clinical legal education. Realist evaluation methodology is increasingly common in health literature to evaluate the impact of education programmes. What this paper adds This is the first empirical study of the use of VR technology to develop professional skills in a distance learning setting. This is the first paper to use realist methodology to evaluate virtual reality technology in legal education.

73,Optimization of Multimodal Japanese Teaching Model Using Virtual Reality,2022,1,,,MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"The potential of virtual reality technology to aid education is well acknowledged. It has already been implemented in at least 20 public schools and institutions, with many more participating in assessment and research initiatives. The proposed methodology is to use virtual reality technology in Japanese teaching in order to create an immersive virtual teaching environment for the learners. They can see and hear Japanese teaching through visual, auditory, tactile, and other senses. They can also interact through virtual reality. The objects simulated by this technology interact with each other, thus creating a feeling of living in a super world. The products of virtual reality technology can be used as a new tool for learning the Japanese language. On the one hand, the advantages of virtual reality technology are assisting Japanese teaching and training due to its immersive, interactive, and systematic characteristics. On the other hand, we can use multimodal data fusion to make the data sources more diversified and optimize the Japanese teaching model through virtual reality technology. In addition, more effective and interesting teaching methods provide references for others. The experimental results show that our multimodal fusion BP (backpropagation) neural network algorithm provides a better result than the single decision tree algorithm and support vector machine algorithm.",Journal
74,Computer-Aided College English Teaching System Based on Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence,2022,1,,1,WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING,"People are realizing that linguistic competence is a vital aspect of communicative competence as language study and instruction have progressed. Grammar instruction is not only important but also the primary means of achieving communication skills in foreign language classes. This article focuses on the computer vision and machine learning-based virtual reality technology college English immersive context teaching approach. The goal is to increase pupils' capacity to learn English. The experimental groups used VR innovation immersive environment education from the standpoint of constructivist theory in a compared teaching experiment with 2 classifications of freshman at a university, while the control class used standard multimedia equipment and conventional teaching techniques. Students only passively acquire a lot of material from instructors in the class, they have limited opportunity to engage in the exchange of information and express thoughts in the chosen language, and they are ""immersed"" in the Chinese environment most of the time. With an average score of 2.8 points higher than the control group, the overall English level was likewise higher. English teaching system based on computer big data method, optimization of oral English teaching system based on computer-aided technology, and artificial intelligence are the existing methods used for comparison. This demonstrates that using constructivism theory and virtual reality technology in college English immersing contextual education may genuinely increase students' English levels.",Journal
75,Mixed Reality for an Enhanced Laboratory Course on Microfluidics,2022,5,Laboratory Instruction Upper-Division Undergraduate Hands-On Learning/Manipulatives Multimedia-Based Learning Applications of Chemistry Liquids Materials Science Transport Properties Laboratory Equipment/Apparatus,1,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION,"Natural sciences can be difficult to grasp because physical and chemical phenomena can take place across time and length scales that are beyond the reach of human perception. This problem is particularly true for students attempting to learn about microfluidics, a discipline that involves intricate engineering methods and fluid phenomena that are unintuitive and unique to the microscopic scale. New learning paradigms that combine established principles from the learning sciences and mixed reality (MR) technologies may facilitate the understanding of microfluidics and help connect the experimental methods to the underlying physical and chemical processes. Yet only a few studies have implemented learning sciences principles into the design of MR experiences for university laboratory courses. We thus created ALETHA, an interactive and immersive MR learning platform to help students learn about microfluidics and microfabrication techniques. We designed ALETHA to include scaffolding, gamification, control-of-variables, and multimodal representation strategies that are known to enhance intuition building and learning. We hypothesized that MR will enhance student understanding of microfluidics and microfabrication and help them build intuitions about the processes involved at that scale. To test whether ALETHA improved affective learning outcomes, we employed quizzes and surveys and compared the performance of students that participated in the course with MR to that of a cohort using traditional paper protocols. Overall, we measured a greater building of intuition and engagement for MR students. Our new learning platform provides a useful and practical example of how MR can be implemented to learn challenging interdisciplinary topics such as microfluidics.",Journal
76,Snailed It! Inside the Shell: Using Augmented Reality as a Window Into Biodiversity,2022,9,"snail, augmented reality, biodiversity, territory, teaching-learning sequence",0,FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION,"Snails have occupied an important role in the ideology and religion of the ancient American peoples, who considered them to be magical and used them in ritual ceremonies as ornaments, musical instruments, and architectural elements. Today, they are a valuable study system for understanding biodiversity and evolution due to their remarkable ecological and morphological diversity. Given that many endemic snails are of conservation concern, and that most South American species are poorly studied, there is a need to engage the public through understandable and scientifically based language, conveying the importance of biodiversity. However, not all biodiversity can be seen with the naked eye. Herein, we describe how we utilize snails and their shells to engage citizens and train teachers to promote the many different facets of biodiversity. Through design-based research oriented toward educational innovation, we created a teaching-learning sequence with immersive technology through the following stages of work: (1) produce a teaching-learning sequence and accompanying mobile device application (for Android on GooglePlay), (2) evaluate the impact of the educational resource, and (3) conduct research through a pre- and posttest design on the learning outcomes of participants. In this work, we first present the field experience where scientists, teachers, and pre-service teachers worked together to find snails from northern Chile to Chiloe Island. Some results from this research stage are: criteria for designing a teaching-learning sequence (e.g., how to utilize place as an opportunity for learning science with developmentally appropriate technologies identified for every phase of the sequence), modeling relevant phenomena about biodiversity and ecosystems through snails, scaffolding for teachers implementing the sequence, and activities that enhance STEM education. A teaching-learning sequence that addresses snails as study objects for 4th grade is presented and validated, allowing us to continue the next phase of our research with schools. A second article will propose results from implementation, iterations, and their implications.",Journal

In this paper, virtual reality was used as an educational technology that allowed users to virtually rotate 3-D objects and helped to enhance their spatial ability, which would be particularly useful in future careers in STEM. A 2 (display) x 2 (controller) x 2 (gender) experimental design was conducted. Researchers used a 2-D monoscopic display and a stereoscopic display to manipulate two different conditions of immersion, while a computer mouse and a hand-held controller were applied to measure the effects from two different levels of interactivity. Gender was examined due to prior research suggesting that males were better at MR tasks than females. The dependent variables were various perceptions and behavioral intentions developed from relevant theories in technology acceptance. The results showed that users' positive perceptions and intention to use the novel MR system were amplified whenever better immersive and interactive experiences were provided simultaneously, or when the inferior immersive and interactive experiences were offered at the same time. Females under a better immersive environment perceived better feelings of enjoyment, confirmation, satisfaction, and behavioral intention, compared with their male counterparts. Theoretical contributions in perceptions and use intention of educational technology, with a specific focus on VR, were discussed. Practical implications for developers of educational technology and K-12/college educators were provided.",Journal
78,vIS: An Immersive Virtual Storytelling System for Vocational Training,2020,4,virtual reality; storytelling; vocational training; usability testing,17,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,"Storytelling has been established as a proven method to effectively communicate and assist in knowledge transfer. In recent years, there has been growing interest in improving the training and learning domain by using advanced technology such as Virtual Reality (VR). However, a gap exists between storytelling and VR, and it is as yet unclear how they can be combined to form an effective system that not only maintains the level of engagement and immersion provided by VR technology but also provides the core strengths of storytelling. In this paper, we present vIS, a Vocational Immersive Storytelling system, which bridges the gap between storytelling and VR. vIS focuses on vocational training, in which users are trained on how to use a mechanical micrometer by employing a creative fictional story embedded inside a virtual manufacturing plant's workplace. For the evaluation, a two-phase user study with 30 participants was conducted to measure the system's effectiveness and improvements in long-term training, as well as to examine user experience against traditional methods of training-2D videos and textual manuals. The results indicate that the user's ability to retain their training after seven days was nearly equal for vIS and the 2D video-based technique and was considerably higher than the text-based technique.",Journal

In addition, although anatomy remains one of the fundamental areas of medical education, universities have decreased the hours allocated to teaching gross anatomy in favor of applied clinical work. The release of virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices allows learning to occur through hands-on immersive experiences. The aim of this research was to assess whether learning structural anatomy utilizing VR or AR is as effective as tablet-based (TB) applications, and whether these modes allowed enhanced student learning, engagement and performance. Participants (n=59) were randomly allocated to one of the three learning modes: VR, AR, or TB and completed a lesson on skull anatomy, after which they completed an anatomical knowledge assessment. Student perceptions of each learning mode and any adverse effects experienced were recorded. No significant differences were found between mean assessment scores in VR, AR, or TB. During the lessons however, VR participants were more likely to exhibit adverse effects such as headaches (25% in VR P<0.05), dizziness (40% in VR, P<0.001), or blurred vision (35% in VR, P<0.01). Both VR and AR are as valuable for teaching anatomy as tablet devices, but also promote intrinsic benefits such as increased learner immersion and engagement. These outcomes show great promise for the effective use of virtual and augmented reality as means to supplement lesson content in anatomical education.

Digital technology can make such sites virtually accessible and provide educational information at the same time. Toward this goal, we created a digital reconstruction of the archaeological site of Choirokoitia. Given that a 3D digital reconstruction can be used along with different technologies, we designed and developed an interactive application, where users can navigate and get information about the site, for two different systems: Virtual Reality (VR) systems and desktop computers. A feasibility study was conducted where we compared aspects of the two systems so as to allow the suggestion of the proper technology to utilize according to a user's aims. The results showed higher levels of presence and more positive experience by the participants who used the VR system compared to those who used the desktop version. On the other hand, greater learning gains were demonstrated in participants who used the desktop version compared to those who used the VR version. No differences were shown between the two groups regarding the participants' change of attitudes toward the archaeology of Cyprus.</p>",Journal

In a higher-education context, these immersive technologies make it possible to teach complex molecular topics in a way that may aid or even supersede traditional approaches such as molecular models, textbook images, and traditional screen-based computational environments. In this work we describe a study involving 22 third-year UK undergraduate chemistry students who undertook a traditional computational chemistry class complemented by an additional component which we designed to utilize real-time interactive molecular dynamics simulations in VR (iMD-VR). Exploiting the flexibility of an open-source iMD-VR framework which we recently described, the students were given three short tasks to complete in iMD-VR: (1) interactive rearrangement of the chorismate molecule to prephenate using forces obtained from density functional theory calculations; (2) unbinding of chorismate from the active site chorismate mutase enzyme using molecular mechanics forces calculated in real-time; and (3) docking of chorismate with chorismate mutase using real-time molecular mechanics forces. A student survey indicated that most students found the iMD-VR component more engaging than the traditional approach, and also that it improved their perceived educational outcomes and their interest in continuing on in the field of computational sciences.",Journal

After the release of the affordable Oculus Go headset and the Merge Cube, there has been increasing use of virtual, augmented, and extended reality (VR, AR, XR) in classrooms. Of significance to chemistry educators are the virtual lab simulations developed by Labster and HoloLab Champions and the VR app Nanome, which can be used to virtually manipulate chemicals and proteins. So far, however, there are no commercially developed products that address the transfer of chemicals and contaminants during experiments or procedures that require gloves. Herein, we discuss how VR can be used as an active learning approach to lab safety about correct glove hygiene. The work is the result of a collaboration among chemistry, computer science, and library faculty on a VR instructional module on glove hygiene. This experience is useful to bring a realistic and interactive laboratory experience to students who may have limited experience in a laboratory setting. Additionally, the project explores how to optimally use the academic library space to deploy the VR module to a large number of student users. Despite shortcomings we encountered in the first phase of development, we believe that, with technological improvements, there is significant potential for a virtual reality instructional environment that teaches glove hygiene when there may be limited access to physical laboratories.",Journal

Dijkstra's algorithm,0,ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY,"Rationale and Objectives: Three-dimensional (3D) visualization has been shown to benefit new generations of medical students and physicians-in-training in a variety of contexts. However, there is limited research directly comparing student performance after using 3D tools to those using two-dimensional (2D) screens.Materials and Methods: A CT was performed on a donated cadaver and a 3D CT hologram was created. A total of 30 first-year medical students were randomly assigned into two groups to review head and neck anatomy in a teaching session that incorporated CT. The first group used an augmented reality headset, while the second group used a laptop screen. The students were administered a five-question anatomy test before and after the session. Two-tailed t-tests were used for statistical comparison of pretest and posttest performance within and between groups. A feedback survey was distributed for qualitative data.Results: Pretest vs. posttest comparison of average percentage of questions answered correctly demonstrated both groups showing significant in-group improvement (p < 0.05), from 59% to 95% in the augmented reality group, and from 57% to 80% in the screen group. Between-group analysis indicated that posttest performance was significantly better in the augmented reality group (p = 0.022, effect size = 0.73).Conclusion: Immersive 3D visualization has the potential to improve short-term anatomic recall in the head and neck compared to traditional 2D screen-based review, as well as engage millennial learners to learn better in anatomy laboratory.

We hypothesized that an international grand rounds using the Microsoft HoloLens 2 extended reality (XR) headset would create an improved bedside-learning experience compared to traditional grand rounds formats.STUDY DESIGN: From December 2020 to March 2021, the world's first 2 international mixed reality grand rounds events using the HoloLens 2 headset were held, broadcasting transatlantically (between the University of Michigan and the Imperial College of London) bedside rounding experiences on 5 complex surgical patients to an international audience of 325 faculty, residents, and medical trainees. Participants completed pre- and post-event surveys to assess their experience.RESULTS: Of the 325 participants, 267 (80%) completed pre-surveys, and 95 (29%) completed both the pre- and post-surveys. Respondents (average age, 38 y; 44% women, 56% men; 211 US, 56 UK) included 92 (34%) medical students and residents and 175 faculty and staff. In the pre-event survey, 76% had little or no earlier experience with XR devices, and 94% thought implementation of XR into medical curricula was valuable. In the post-survey, 96% thought telerounding using XR technology was important for the current era, and 99% thought the ability to visualize the examination, imaging, and laboratory results at bedside via XR rounding was highly valuable and that this format was superior to traditional grand rounds.CONCLUSIONS: Almost all of the participants in the mixed reality international grand rounds felt the immersive XR experiences-allowing visualization of clinical findings, imaging, and laboratory results at the patient's bedside-were superior to a traditional grand rounds format, and that it could be a valuable tool for surgical teaching and telerounding.

85,An immersive first-person navigation task for abstract knowledge acquisition,2021,5,,7,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Advances in virtual reality (VR) technology have greatly benefited spatial navigation research. By presenting space in a controlled manner, changing aspects of the environment one at a time or manipulating the gain from different sensory inputs, the mechanisms underlying spatial behaviour can be investigated. In parallel, a growing body of evidence suggests that the processes involved in spatial navigation extend to non-spatial domains. Here, we leverage VR technology advances to test whether participants can navigate abstract knowledge. We designed a two-dimensional quantity space-presented using a head-mounted display-to test if participants can navigate abstract knowledge using a first-person perspective navigation paradigm. To investigate the effect of physical movement, we divided participants into two groups: one walking and rotating on a motion platform, the other group using a gamepad to move through the abstract space. We found that both groups learned to navigate using a first-person perspective and formed accurate representations of the abstract space. Interestingly, navigation in the quantity space resembled behavioural patterns observed in navigation studies using environments with natural visuospatial cues. Notably, both groups demonstrated similar patterns of learning. Taken together, these results imply that both self-movement and remote exploration can be used to learn the relational mapping between abstract stimuli.",Journal

On the other hand, augmented reality is a technology that allows extending visible reality in a mobile device, which can result in greater emotional well-being for the student. However, it is not clear how to integrate algorithm animations with augmented reality. The article makes two contributions to this concern. On the one hand, we describe an architecture that allows generating interactive algorithm animations, integrating them appropriately in the context of immersive augmented reality. This way the user can watch the source code of the algorithm, augmented with textual explanations, visualizations and animations of its behavior. We illustrate the use of the architecture by instantiating it to the well-known Dijkstra's algorithm, resulting in an augmented reality tool that generates text, 2D and 3D visualizations. On the other hand, the influence of the tool on the user's emotions has been studied by conducting an experience with face-to-face and online students. The results show that, with the joint use of augmented reality and visualizations, the students: experienced significantly more positive than negative emotions, experienced more agitation and stimulation than inactivity or calm, enjoyed as much as they expected, and their feeling of boredom decreased during the experience. However, students felt anxiety from the beginning and it increased with the use of augmented reality.

The aim of this study was to determine knot tying skills taught with a 360-degree VR video compared to conventional 2D video teaching.Material and methods: This trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study. 40 foundation year doctors (first year postgraduate) were randomised to either the 360-degree VR video (n = 20) or 2D video teaching (n = 20). Participants were given 15 min to watch their allocated video. Ability to fie a single handed reef knot was then assessed against a marking criteria developed for the Royal College of Surgeons, England, (RCSeng) Basic Surgical Skills (BSS) course, by a blinded assessor competent in knot tying. Each candidate then underwent further teaching using Peyton's four step model. Knot tying technique was then re-assessed.Results: Knot tying scores were significantly better in the VR video teaching arm when compared with conventional (median knot score 5.0 vs 4.0 p = 0.04). When used in combination with face to face skills teaching this difference persisted (median knot score 9.5 vs 9.0 p = 0.01). More people in the VR arm constructed a complete reef knot than in the 2D arm following face to face teaching (17/20 vs 12/20). No difference between the groups existed in the time taken to construct a reef knot following video and teaching (median time 31.0s vs 30.5s p = 0.89).Conclusion: This study shows there is significant merit in the application of 360-degree VR video technology in surgical training, both as an independent teaching aid and when used as an adjunct to traditional face to face teaching.",Journal

The Centre for Innovative Applications of Internet and Multimedia Technologies (AIMTech Centre) at City University of Hong Kong developed a VR-enabled training program to examine its efficacy on emotional and social skills with six VR scenarios depicting the daily lives of typical children in Hong Kong. 94 children from mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong completed the study and 72 children were included in the analysis. Children from training group scored higher on emotion expression and regulation (M = 20.2, SD = 3.00) than before the training (M = 1 8.9 , SD = 3.57, t(35) = -2.174, p = .037) and higher on social interaction and adaptation after the training (M = 21.8, SD = 2.99) than before training (M = 20.2, SD = 3.43, t(35) = -3.987, p < .0005). There was a statistically significant interaction between group and time on affective expressions, F(1,70) = 5.223,p = .025, partial n(2)= .069, and on social reciprocity, F(1,70) = 7.769, p = .007, partial n(2) = .100. Children were able to engage in VR training despite initial challenges with viewing goggles.

However, the limited resolution and luminance values offered by the devices might affect the perceived appearance and high-order impressions in the simulated virtual environment. In this study, a simulated 3-dimensional virtual office was compared against a real one. Both settings presented similar physical and luminous conditions to twenty participants (N = 20). The study investigated subjective and objective visual responses and participants' interaction with the virtual environment based on measurements of perceived presence. Subjective assessments included questions on luminous environment appearance (brightness, colour-temperature, distribution) and high-order perceptions (pleasantness, interest, spaciousness, excitement and complexity). Objective assessments measured contrast-sensitivity and colour-discrimination tasks to assess visual performance across the two representation environments. Results showed no significant differences between the two environments based on the studied parameters, indicating a high level of perceptual accuracy of appearance and high-order perceptions. Minor physical symptoms related to the headset use and high level of perceived presence were found, indicating the proposed methodology's capability to provide realistic immersive environments. Although attributes regarding scene quality: colours, details, and contrast were perceived significantly different to the real environment, objective tasks showed that similar contrast and colour appearance can be produced in the virtual environment with minor impact on fine-details due to limited resolution. Virtual reality maybe a promising alternative representation medium to investigate visual perceptions as the overall appearance of the scene can still be correctly acquired.",Journal

CBT techniques can be delivered more effectively using VR as well. So far, VR has required high-quality devices, but the development of mobile VR technology has improved user availability. At the same time, a well-structured form of VR can be reproduced and used anywhere. This means that VR can be used to provide a self-guided form of treatment and address the high treatment costs of evidence-based therapy and the lack of professional therapists. This study aimed to investigate the potential of self-guided VR as an alternative to high-cost treatment.Objective: The main goal of this study was to offer data about the efficacy of a mobile app-based self-led VR CBT in the treatment of panic disorder.Methods: A total of 54 subjects with panic disorder were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to either the VR treatment group or waitlist group. The VR treatment was designed to be total 12 sessions for 4 weeks. The VR treatment consists of 4 steps in which patients are gradually exposed to phobic stimuli while learning to cope with panic symptoms in each stage. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed through the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Body Sensations Questionnaire, Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire, Anxiety Sensitivity Index, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Korean Inventory of Social Avoidance and Distress Scale, Korean Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and Perceived Stress Scale. In addition, physiological changes using heart rate variability were evaluated.Results: In within-group analyses, the VR treatment group exhibited improvements in panic disorder symptoms, anxiety, and depression after 4 weeks, while the waitlist group did not show any significant improvement. Compared to the waitlist group, the VR treatment group showed significantly greater improvements in the Panic Disorder Severity Scale in both completer analysis and intention-to-treat analysis. Heart rate variability in the VR treatment group showed improvement in normalized high frequency from baseline to postassessment with no significant differences in any outcome measure between groups.Conclusions: The self-guided, mobile app-based VR intervention was effective in the treatment of panic symptoms and restoring the autonomic nervous system demonstrating the validity of the use of VR for self-guided treatment.

Second, we form a virtual classroom teaching system, which includes a cloud system, communication equipment, and a VR classroom applet. Finally, we design the interaction scheme between teachers and students in situational English teaching. The experimental results demonstrate that our method improves teaching effectiveness, which has significant implications for English teaching. ¬© 2022 Hui Ding and Mingyang Qi.",Journal
94,Training birdsong recognition using virtual reality,2021,3,Human computer interaction; Virtual environment; Birdsong; Audio training; User engagement,1,Virtual Reality and Intelligent Hardware,"Background: In mega-biodiverse environments, where different species are more likely to be heard than seen, species monitoring is generally performed using bioacoustics methodologies. Furthermore, since bird vocalizations are reasonable estimators of biodiversity, their monitoring is of great importance in the formulation of conservation policies. However, birdsong recognition is an arduous task that requires dedicated training in order to achieve mastery, which is costly in terms of time and money due to the lack of accessibility of relevant information in field trips or even specialized databases. Immersive technology based on virtual reality (VR) and spatial audio may improve species monitoring by enhancing information accessibility, interaction, and user engagement. Methods: This study used spatial audio, a Bluetooth controller, and a head-mounted display (HMD) to conduct an immersive training experience in VR. Participants moved inside a virtual world using a Bluetooth controller, while their task was to recognize targeted birdsongs. We measured the accuracy of recognition and user engagement according to the User Engagement Scale. Results: The experimental results revealed significantly higher engagement and accuracy for participants in the VR-based training system than in a traditional computer-based training system. All four dimensions of the user engagement scale received high ratings from the participants, suggesting that VR-based training provides a motivating and attractive environment for learning demanding tasks through appropriate design, exploiting the sensory system, and virtual reality interactivity. Conclusions: The accuracy and engagement of the VR-based training system were significantly high when tested against traditional training. Future research will focus on developing a variety of realistic ecosystems and their associated birds to increase the information on newer bird species within the training system. Finally, the proposed VR-based training system must be tested with additional participants and for a longer duration to measure information recall and recognition mastery among users. ¬© 2021 Beijing Zhongke Journal Publishing Co.

96,Lessons Learned From Immersive and Desktop VR Training of Mines Rescuers,2021,5,"Virtual reality, Immersive technology, Training, High risk industry, Mining industry, Regression modelling, Prediction",3,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,"This paper discusses results from two successive rounds of virtual mines rescue training. The first round was conducted in a surround projection environment (360-VR), and the second round was conducted in desktop virtual reality (Desktop-VR). In the 360-VR condition, trainees participated as groups, making collective decisions. In the Desktop-VR condition, trainees could control their avatars individually. Overall, 372 participants took part in this study, including 284 mines rescuers who took part in 360-VR, and 243 in Desktop-VR. (155 rescuers experienced both.) Each rescuer who trained in 360-VR completed a battery of pre- and post-training questionnaires. Those who attended the Desktop-VR session only completed the post-training questionnaire. We performed principal components analysis on the questionnaire data, followed by a multiple regression analysis, the results of which suggest that the chief factor contributing to positive learning outcome was Learning Context, which extracted information about the quality of the learning content, the trainers, and their feedback. Subjective feedback from the Desktop-VR participants indicated that they preferred Desktop-VR to 360-VR for this training activity, which highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate platform for training applications, and links back to the importance of Learning Context. Overall, we conclude the following: 1) it is possible to train effectively using a variety of technologies but technology that is well-suited to the training task is more useful than technology that is ‚Äúmore advanced,‚Äù and 2) factors that have always been important in training, such as the quality of human trainers, remain critical for virtual reality training.

99,Virtual & augmented reality for biological microscope in experiment education,2020,4,Virtual realityAugmented realityMicroscopeOperating guideExperiment,45,Virtual Reality and Intelligent Hardware,"BackgroundMixed-reality technologies, including virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), are considered to be promising potential tools for science teaching and learning processes that could foster positive emotions, motivate autonomous learning, and improve learning outcomes. Methods: In this study, a technology-aided biological microscope learning system based on VR/AR is presented. The structure of the microscope is described in a detailed three-dimensional (3D) model, each component being represented with their topological interrelationships and associations among them being established. The interactive behavior of the model was specified, and a standard operating guide was compiled. The motion control of components was simulated based on collision detection. Combined with immersive VR equipment and AR technology, we developed a virtual microscope subsystem and a mobile virtual microscope guidance system. Results: The system consisted of a VR subsystem and an AR subsystem. The focus of the VR subsystem was to simulate operating the microscope and associated interactive behaviors that allowed users to observe and operate the components of the 3D microscope model by means of natural interactions in an immersive scenario. The AR subsystem allowed participants to use a mobile terminal that took a picture of a microscope from a textbook and then displayed the structure and functions of the instrument, as well as the relevant operating guidance. This flexibly allowed students to use the system before or after class without time and space constraints. The system allowed users to switch between the VR and AR subsystems. Conclusions: The system is useful for helping learners (especially K-12 students) to recognize a microscope's structure and grasp the required operational skills by simulating operations using an interactive process. In the future, such technology-assisted education would be a successful learning platform in an open learning space. ¬© 2019 Beijing Zhongke Journal Publishing Co. Ltd",Journal

The digital society demands students with a digital competence, and it is the responsibility of the university institution to ensure they succeed in obtaining it. This article presents an innovative immersive experience developed in a seminar on emerging technologies with 231 university students, and records their perceptions of some augmented reality apps used on the Social Education degree course and the Social Work and Social Education joint degree course at Pablo de Olavide University in Seville (Spain) in the academic years 2016-2018. A qualitative exploratory descriptive study was used to analyse the experience. The study presents the most important findings of this experience with augmented reality at the university, and proposes some didactic uses for the most interesting of these apps, with attention to their usability, ease of use and capacity to help early-stage learners to acquire new knowledge. Students considered that AR apps would provide educational scenarios that were more stimulating, collaborative and interactive, and would foment a more open type of education (N= 159/68.8%). The principal conclusion is using this technology in the psychosocial treatment of problems could help social area professionals to sharpen their competences and, at the same time, reinforce support and improve the conditions and treatments of aspects identified in these at risk groups. ¬© 2020 The authors and IJLTER.ORG.

101,A study of developments and applications of mixed reality cubicles and their impact on learning,2020,3,A study of developments and applications of mixed reality cubicles and their impact on learning,9,International Journal of Information and Learning Technology,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report on developments and applications of mixed reality cubicles and their impacts on learning in higher education. This paper investigates and presents the cost effective application of augmented reality (AR) as a mixed reality technology via or to mobile devices such as head-mounted devices, smart phones and tablets. Discuss the development of mixed reality applications for mobile (smartphones and tablets) devices leading up to the implementation of a mixed reality cubicle for immersive three dimensional (3D) visualizations. Design/methodology/approach: The approach adopted was to limit the considerations to the application of AR via mobile platforms including head-mounted devices with focus on smartphones and tablets, which contain basic feedback‚Äìto-user channels such as speakers and display screens. An AR visualization cubicle was jointly developed and applied by three collaborating institutions. The markers, acting as placeholders acts as identifiable reference points for objects being inserted in the mixed reality world. Hundreds of participants comprising academics and students from seven different countries took part in the studies and gave feedback on impact on their learning experience. Findings: Results from current study show less than 30 percent had used mixed reality environments. This is lower than expected. About 70 percent of participants were first time users of mixed reality technologies. This indicates a relatively low use of mixed reality technologies in education. This is consistent with research findings reported that educational use and research on AR is still not common despite their categorization as emerging technologies with great promise for educational use. Research limitations/implications: Current research has focused mainly on cubicles which provides immersive experience if used with head-mounted devices (goggles and smartphones), that are limited by their display/screen sizes. There are some issues with limited battery lifetime for energy to function, hence the need to use rechargeable batteries. Also, the standard dimension of cubicles does not allow for group visualizations. The current cubicle has limitations associated with complex gestures and movements involving two hands, as one hand are currently needed for holding the mobile phone. Practical implications: The use of mixed reality cubicles would allow and enhance information visualization for big data in real time and without restrictions. There is potential to have this extended for use in exploring and studying otherwise inaccessible locations such as sea beds and underground caves. Social implications ‚Äì Following on from this study further work could be done to developing and application of mixed reality cubicles that would impact businesses, health and entertainment. Originality/value: The originality of this paper lies in the unique approach used in the study of developments and applications of mixed reality cubicles and their impacts on learning. The diverse composition in nature and location of participants drawn from many countries comprising of both tutors and students adds value to the present study. The value of this research include amongst others, the useful results obtained and scope for developments in the future. ¬© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Journal
102,Immersive research experiences for high school students aimed at promoting diversity and visibility in pharmacy education,2020,4,"research, diversity, high school, pharmaceutical sciences, pipeline",6,American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education,"Two challenges frequently faced by schools of pharmacy are the training of a workforce that reflects the racial and ethnic diversity of the populations they serve, as well as raising public awareness of the mission and impact of pharmacy schools. One underutilized strategy in addressing these challenges is directly engaging high school students, whose race and ethnicity more closely reflect the increasing diversity of the US population, in immersive research experiences at schools of pharmacy. Motivated by the multidisciplinary nature of pharmaceutical sciences that involve integration of various science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy created the Young Innovators Program (YIP). The program is an eight-week paid summer internship that immerses participants in cutting-edge and innovative research.

A total of 200 college students were selected and divided evenly into four groups by the random number table method: long-time game (LTG), medium-time game(MTG), short-time game (STG) and non-game (NG) group. Each group has 25 moles and 25 females. The members of first three groups were asked to play a horror game for 10,20 and 30min, respectively. Then, all the subjects underwent the Implicit Association Test (IAT), followed by a word identification task, in which the correct number of responses and reaction time of each student were recorded. The results show that the LTG group outperformed the other groups in cognitive processing and correctness of word identification; the affective state of the fixed intensity level can improve cognitive processing, the hyper-high level of affective activation interferes with or even hinders cognitive processing, and the excessively low activation is insufficient to support cognitive processing. The research results shed new light on the application of immersive VR technology in cognitive learning. ¬© 2020 Fundacion Aigle.",Journal

Nurses are often first responders at in-hospital cardiac arrests and receive annual basic life support training to ensure they have the adequate skills, and student nurses are taught this in preparation for their clinical practice. However, it is clear that some nurses still lack confidence and skills to perform basic life support in an emergency situation. This innovative study included 209 participants, used a mixed-methods approach, and examined three environments to compare confidence and skills in basic life support training. The environments were nonimmersive (basic skills room), immersive (immersive room with video technology), and the Octave (mixed reality facility). The skills were measured using a Laerdal training manikin (QCPR manikin), with data recorded on a wireless Laerdal Simpad, and confidence levels before and after training were measured using a questionnaire. The nonimmersive and the immersive rooms were familiar environments, and the students felt more comfortable, relaxed, and, thus, more confident. The Octave offered the higher level of simulation utilizing virtual reality technology. Students felt less comfortable and less confident in the Octave; we assert that this was because the environment was unfamiliar. The study identified that placing students in an unfamiliar environment influences the confidence and skills associated with basic life support; this could be used as a way of preparing student nurses with the necessary emotional resilience to cope in stressful situations.

At the same time, the boom in Industry 4.0 manufacturing has brought down the prices of these technological tools making them generally more affordable. A case in point is 360-degree spherical video cameras and software that can record, render and playback immersive 'real life' contents. 360-degree spherical video contents can then be rendered and post-processed into VR (virtual reality) experiences that are not just immersive but also allow for limitless exposure time to learners. Both technologies allow for learner-driven learning to happen in the truest sense, for instance for second and foreign language learners. This research paper examines data collected from 560 undergraduates (n = 560) who were immersed and exposed to 360-degree videos and VR experiences for degree level courses on English (as a second language), Mandarin (Chinese) (as a third or foreign language, and Arabic (as a third or foreign language) at four public university campuses in Peninsular Malaysia. The benefits of 360-degree videos and VR experiences in second and foreign languages content delivery were evident to support learner-driven learning: Contents were developed by local lecturers and then uploaded for free online and learners could learn anytime, anywhere; total immersion could be achieved using cheap VR goggles powered by learners' smartphones; and most beneficially, weaker learners who desperately need more time to understand and practice difficult degree level second or foreign languages now have the freedom to revise and upskill themselves at their own pace. ¬© 2020 ASTES Publishers.

106,The effect of stereoscopic three-dimensional images on vocabulary learning,2019,1,Vocabulary learning; Stereoscopic 3D images; Multimedia; Virtual reality; Immersive environments,11,Contemporary Educational Technology,"Vocabulary is crucial for language learning. Therefore, searching for the most effective methods to master vocabulary is an important quest. This study investigated the effect of stereoscopic three-dimensional (S3D) images on recall and retention of foreign language vocabulary. S3D images, frequently used in virtual reality visualizations, are highly realistic and differ from non-stereoscopic three-dimensional (NS3D) images in that they provide an impression of depth. In this within-subject study, American subjects (N = 82) were exposed to 16 Polish words accompanied by corresponding images. Half of these images were in NS3D format, and half were in S3D format. The vocabulary was counterbalanced throughout four randomly distributed versions of the experiment. Quantitative data were drawn from immediately administered and one-week-delayed productive and receptive vocabulary tests. Qualitative data were gathered through background questionnaires and follow-up surveys, which included a mixture of open-ended and Likert scale questions. Two-tailed, paired t-tests showed no significant difference on vocabulary recall and retention of test scores for words represented with NS3D and S3D images. Post hoc tests revealed that lower performance on S3D images occurred only for those subgroups of subjects who exhibited discomfort or lack of experience with S3D technology, or both. ¬© 2019, Anadolu University, Faculty of Communication Sciences.

However, preparing principals for this task has proven elusive despite many changes in programming by insti-tutions of higher learning. Emerging technologies that rely on augmented and virtual realities are posited to be powerful pedagogical tools for closing this gap. Background This study investigated the effects of immersive simulation technologies on principals' self-efficacy after treatment and the perceived significance of the design of the immersive simulation experience as an effective tool for adult learners. Methodology The investigator employed a multiple-methods study that relied on a purposive sample of graduate students enrolled in educational leadership programs at two small universities in the southeastern United States. Participants completed a two-hour module of immersive simulation designed to facilitate transfer of knowledge to skills thereby increasing their self-efficacy. Contribution This paper contributes to a small body of literature that examines the use of immersive simulation to prepare aspiring principals. Findings The findings indicate moderate effect sizes in changes in self-efficacy, positive attitudes toward immersive simulation as a pedagogical tool, and significance in the design of immersive simulation modules.

114,Career Interview Readiness in Virtual Reality (CIRVR): A Platform for Simulated Interview Training for Autistic Individuals and Their Employers,2022,10,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, virtual job interview",3,ACM Trans. Access. Comput.,"Employment outcomes for autistic1 individuals are often poorer relative to their neurotypical (NT) peers, resulting in a greater need for other forms of financial and social support. While a great deal of work has focused on developing interventions for autistic children, relatively less attention has been paid to directly addressing the employment challenges faced by autistic adults. One key impediment to autistic individuals securing employment is the job interview. Autistic individuals often experience anxiety in interview situations, particularly with open-ended questions and unexpected interruptions. They also exhibit atypical gaze patterns that may be perceived as, but not necessarily indicative of, disinterest or inattention. In response, we developed a closed-loop adaptive virtual reality (VR)‚Äìbased job interview training platform, which we have named Career Interview Readiness in VR (CIRVR). CIRVR is designed to provide an engaging, adaptive, and individualized experience to practice and refine interviewing skills in a less anxiety-inducing virtual context. CIRVR contains a real-time physiology-based stress detection module, as well as a real-time gaze detection module, to permit individualized adaptation. We also present the first prototype of the CIRVR Dashboard, which provides visualizations of data to help autistic individuals as well as potential employers and job coaches make sense of the data gathered from interview sessions. We conducted a feasibility study with 9 autistic and 8 NT individuals to assess the preliminary usability and feasibility of CIRVR. Results showed differences in perceived usability of the system between autistic and NT participants, and higher levels of stress in autistic individuals during interviews. Participants across both groups reported satisfaction with CIRVR and the structure of the interview. These findings and feedback will support future work in improving CIRVR‚Äôs features in hopes for it to be a valuable tool to support autistic job candidates as well as their potential employers.",Journal

They offer both practical and pedagogical benefits, but there are concerns about the effect that perceptual deficiencies in VR systems (e.g. reduced haptic information, and stereoscopic display distortions) may have on learning and performance. 'Specificity of learning' theories suggest that VR could be ineffective (or even detrimental) if important differences (e.g. perceptual deficiencies) exist between practice and real task performance conditions. Nevertheless, 'structural learning' theories suggest VR could be a useful training tool, despite these deficiencies, because a trainee can still learn the underlying structure of the behaviour. We explored these theoretical predictions using golf putting as an exemplar skill. In Experiment 1 we used a repeated measures design to assess putting accuracy (radial error) and quiet eye duration of expert golfers (n = 18) on real putts before and after 40 VR 'warm up' putts. In Experiment 2, novice golfers (n = 40) were assigned to either VR or real-world putting training. Putting accuracy and quiet eye durations were then assessed on a real-world retention test. Both visual guidance (quiet eye) and putting accuracy were disrupted temporarily when moving from VR to real putting (Experiment 1). However, real-world and VR practice produced comparable improvements in putting accuracy in novice golfers (Experiment 2). Overall, the results suggest that: (i) underlying skill structures can be learned in VR and transferred to the real-world; (ii) perceptual deficiencies will place limits on the use of VR. These findings demonstrate the challenges and opportunities for VR as a training tool, and emphasise the need to empirically test the costs and benefits of specific systems before deploying VR training. ‚Ä¢ VR is rapidly being adopted as a training method for visuomotor skills in sport. ‚Ä¢ Experiment 1 tested the effect of VR when used as a 'warm-up' for golf putting. ‚Ä¢ Experiment 2 tested the effectiveness of learning the golf putt in VR. ‚Ä¢ VR caused temporary disruptions to quiet eye and putting accuracy (Expt 1). ‚Ä¢ Putting improvement was comparable between real-world and VR training (Expt 2).",Journal
117,A virtual reality platform for memory evaluation: Assessing effects of spatial strategies.,2021,6,Virtual reality · Spatial memory · Immersion · Computer-assisted virtual environment · Navigation,1,Behavior Research Methods,"Human spatial memories are usually evaluated using computer screens instead of real arenas or landscapes where subjects could move voluntarily and use allocentric cues to guide their behavior. A possible approach to fill this gap is the adoption of virtual reality, which provides the opportunity to create spatial memory tasks closer to real-life experience. Here we present and evaluate a new software to create experiments using this technology. Specifically, we have developed a spatial memory task that is carried out in a computer-assisted virtual environment where participants walk around a virtual arena using a joystick. This spatial memory task provides an immersive environment where the spatial component is constantly present without the use of virtual reality goggles. The design is similar to that of tasks used for animal studies, allowing a direct comparison across species. We found that only participants who reported using spatial cues to guide their behavior showed significant learning and performed significantly better during a memory test. This tool allows evaluation of human spatial memory in an ecological environment and will be useful to develop a wide range of other tasks to assess spatial cognition.

119,Augmented reality in medical education: students' experiences and learning outcomes.,2021,5,Augmented reality; medical education; education technology; online learning; learning outcomes,30,Medical Education Online,"Augmented reality (AR) is a relatively new technology that allows for digitally generated three-dimensional representations to be integrated with real environmental stimuli. AR can make use of smart phones, tablets, or other devices to achieve a highly stimulating learning environment and hands-on immersive experience. The use of AR in industry is becoming widespread with applications being developed for use not just for entertainment and gaming but also healthcare, retail and marketing, education, military, travel and tourism, automotive industry, manufacturing, architecture, and engineering. Due to the distinct learning advantages that AR offers, such as remote learning and interactive simulations, AR-based teaching programs are also increasingly being adopted within medical schools across the world. These advantages are further highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused an even greater shift towards online learning. In this review, we investigate the use of AR in medical training/education and its effect on students' experiences and learning outcomes. This includes the main goals of AR-based learning, such as to simplify the delivery and enhance the comprehension of complex information. We also describe how AR can enhance the experiences of medical students, by improving knowledge and understanding, practical skills and social skills. These concepts are discussed within the context of specific AR medical training programs, such as HoloHuman, OculAR SIM, and HoloPatient. Finally, we discuss the challenges of AR in learning and teaching and propose future directions for the use of this technology in medical education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Journal
120,Can an immersive virtual reality simulation increase students' interest and career aspirations in science?,2020,3,,66,British Journal of Educational Technology,"Science‚Äêrelated competencies are demanded in many fields, but attracting more students to scientific educations remains a challenge. This paper uses two studies to investigate the value of using Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) laboratory simulations in science education. In Study 1, 99 (52 male, 47 female) seventh (49) and eighth (50) grade students between 13 and 16 years of age used an IVR laboratory safety simulation with a pre‚Äê to posttest design. Results indicated an overall increase in interest in science and self‚Äêefficacy, but only females reported an increase in science career aspirations. Study 2 was conducted with 131 (47 male, 84 female) second (77) and third (54) year high school students aged 17 to 20 and used an experimental design to compare the value of using an IVR simulation or a video of the simulation on the topic of DNA‚Äêanalysis. The IVR group reported significantly higher gains from pre‚Äê to posttest on interest, and social‚Äêoutcome expectations than the video group. Furthermore, both groups had significant gains in self‚Äêefficacy and physical outcome expectations, but the increase in career aspirations and self‚Äêoutcome expectations did not reach statistical significance. Thus, results from the two studies suggest that appropriately developed and implemented IVR simulations can address some of the challenges currently facing science education.

121,Cardiopulmonary resuscitation training for high school students using an immersive 360‚Äêdegree virtual reality environment.,2020,7,"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, virtual reality, medical education, immersive environment",9,British Journal of Educational Technology,"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a lifesaving emergency procedure. To increase survival rates, it is recommended to increase the number of high school students who know how to perform CPR. We have developed an immersive ""Virtual Reality (VR) Resuscitation Training"" to train the theoretical knowledge of CPR in which trainees must save the life of the patient in a virtual environment. This paper presents a randomized controlled study with a pre‚Äêposttest design to explore whether a VR enhanced curriculum improves high school students' theoretical CPR knowledge. Forty students without previous CPR experience in the past year were randomly assigned to either the VR group or the standard group. The VR group had a significant higher increase of correct answers in comparison with the Standard group. More importantly, the gain in score on taking the correct sequence of CPR steps was significant favouring the VR‚Äêenhanced protocol over the Standard protocol. Therefore, the use of a VR training for CPR training appears to be an effective learning method for non‚Äêmedical students and may be of great value skilling high school students in becoming adequate CPR providers.

122,Cognitive and affective processes for learning science in immersive virtual reality.,2021,2,"affective processing, cognitive processing, multimedia, science learning, virtual reality",78,Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,"As immersive virtual reality (IVR) systems proliferate in classrooms, it is important to understand how they affect learning outcomes and the underlying affective and cognitive processes that may cause these outcomes. Proponents argue that IVR could improve learning by increasing positive affective and cognitive processing, thereby supporting improved performance on tests of learning outcome, whereas opponents of IVR contend that it could hurt learning by increasing distraction, thereby disrupting cognitive learning processes and leading to poorer learning outcomes. In a media comparison study, students viewed a biology lesson either as an interactive animated journey in IVR or as a slideshow on a desktop monitor. Those who viewed the IVR lesson performed significantly worse on transfer tests, reported higher emotional arousal, reported more extraneous cognitive load and showed less engagement based on EEG measures than those who viewed the slideshow lesson, with or without practice questions added to the lessons. Mediational analyses showed that the lower retention scores for the IVR lesson were related to an increase in self‚Äêreported extraneous cognitive load and emotional arousal. These results support the notion that immersive environments create high affective and cognitive distraction, which leads to poorer learning outcomes than desktop environments. Lay Description: What is already known about the topic: IVR is gaining popularity in classrooms, and it is important to understand its effects on learning.Some theories suggest IVR could help learning because it may increase motivation.Other theories suggest IVR could hurt learning because it causes distraction. What this paper adds: The biology lesson displayed in IVR led to less learning than a PowerPoint lesson.Viewing the IVR lesson caused higher emotional arousal than viewing the PowerPoint lesson.The IVR lesson led to more distraction based on self‚Äêreport and EEG measures than the PowerPoint lesson.These results suggest that IVR creates high emotional and cognitive distraction, which leads to less learning. Implications for practice: Using IVR to replace traditional classroom lessons may not yet be useful.However, because students report enjoying IVR, it may be useful to use in addition to conventional lessons.Future research should determine how specific factors of the technology and the learners affect learning outcomes.

123,Comparing perceptions of a dimmable LED lighting system between a real space and a virtual reality display.,2021,7,,10,Lighting Research & Technology,"Over the last several decades, designers have used digital screens to view images of real and simulated spaces and make critical design decisions. Screen technology has improved during this time, as technologies like OLED have replaced legacy displays (CRT, plasma, and LCD). These new screens provide a higher pixel resolution, luminous output and contrast ratio. Immersive head-mounted displays now allow designers to view immersive images, and recent developments in real-time rendering have encouraged the uptake of virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays in mainstream practice and design education. This paper presents an experiment on lighting perception using a series of LED lighting conditions in a real space and a virtual representation of those conditions captured using a 360¬∞ high-dynamic-range camera and presented on an HTC Vive Pro HMD. Fifty-three participants were asked to rate each lighting condition by viewing it in a real space (n = 30) or via immersive HDR photographs displayed in a VR HMD (n = 23). The results show that ratings of visual comfort, pleasantness, evenness, contrast and glare are similar between the HTC Vive Pro HMD and our real space when evaluating well-lit scenes, but significant differences emerge in dim and highly contrasted scenes for a number of rating scales.

124,Comparison of Building Design Assessment Behaviors of Novices in Augmented- and Virtual-Reality Environments.,2020,4,Architecture engineering; Augmented and virtual realities; Current generation; Design and construction; Design assessments; Explicit knowledge; Industry standards; Research methodologies,15,Journal of Architectural Engineering,"Design and construction professionals must make well-informed decisions for every project that meets both industry standards and building codes and also the specific needs of building users and clients. In order to make effective decisions, research suggests that explicit knowledge, defined as easily codified and communicated information, and tacit knowledge, considered to be the know-how of completing a task, must be effectively applied. While there is recognition of the need for both forms of knowledge, architecture engineering and construction (AEC) education has historically focused on covering content-related explicit knowledge in the classroom. As a result, students generally develop tacit knowledge over their careers. Due to an aging AEC workforce, there is a need to support tacit knowledge development in the classroom to enable students entering the industry to supplement the collective tacit knowledge that will exit the industry as the current generation of practitioners retires. Therefore, the authors of this paper explore the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) to provide immersive virtual experiences aimed at replicating the types of scenarios that students might experience in their careers that would require them to apply tacit knowledge. The authors tasked students in construction-related disciplines with assessing a building design and making judgments about how the design should be modified to support an occupant in a wheelchair in both VR and AR. Using two similar models and a counterbalanced research methodology, the authors coded the statements and behaviors of the student participants during this design assessment exercise. The results of this work indicate that both technologies elicited statements that were indicative of explicit knowledge related to the needs of a wheelchair-bound occupant. When AR and VR were found to directly encourage physical exploration in the experience, both led to behaviors that simulated the completion of tasks that might be performed by a wheelchair-bound occupant. These behaviors were frequently followed by comments that were indicative of tacit knowledge. While this type of behavior was observed in both AR and VR, AR seemed to more directly encourage this type of interaction among participants. The contribution of this work is in providing observational evidence to demonstrate how the physical exploration affordances of AR and VR may be able to support experiences that foster the use and development of tacit knowledge related to AEC-related decision-making.

125,Comparison of Single and Multiuser Immersive Mobile Virtual Reality Usability in Construction Education.,2021,2,Learning experience; Mobile; Multiuser; Virtual reality; Virtual reality usability,14,Journal of Educational Technology & Society,"Immersive virtual reality (IVR) and mobile technologies have been identified as important in reimaging information delivery and pedagogy. This, coupled with evolving research in single (SUVR) and multiuser (MUVR) IVR environments, may enhance educational practice. However, there is limited research on the impact of such technologies on the learners' experience in authentic learning environments, such as building information modeling in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) workflows. This paper addresses this through a study of forty-eight participants recruited from a postgraduate construction course at an Australian University to answer a research question on how mobile MUVR is more useable than mobile SUVR when experiencing building information models. A within-subjects' experiment was performed using a mixed-methods approach assessing participant mobile IVR Usability on a 5-point Likert scale across four constructs and analysis of reflective sentiment and essays. The results show that when the participants moved from SUVR to MUVR, this significantly increased the overall perceived mobile IVR Usability. Combined with the qualitative analysis, these results suggest that MUVR influences mobile IVR Usability and an increase in learner experience. This study can be used as a launchpad for future research that will explore the causes of the evolution of the enhancement that MUVR provides, expanding beyond the scope of AEC education and industries.

Students successfully completed the experiments and showed learning gains similar to students performing real world experiments, as shown by pre/postlab quizzes and a laboratory practicum. Student participants held positive views of their experience in the SL chemistry laboratory. Teaching assistants provided an important perspective about using the virtual world for laboratory instruction. Overall, results of this pilot study suggest that virtual worlds can be effective for teaching chemistry experiments.

However, there is a lack of empirical research exploring the educational influence of using Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) in science classrooms. To address this gap, this study developed a series of IVR‚Äêbased science lessons for middle‚Äêschool students and further examined these lessons' effects on learning performance. Our quasi‚Äêexperimental approach employed a pretest and posttest to measure academic achievement and questionnaires to measure engagement and technology acceptance. A total of 90 sixth‚Äêgrade students from two classes were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group engaged with the science lessons using Head‚ÄêMounted Displays, whereas the control group learned the same material through traditional teaching methods. The results revealed that the experimental group obtained significantly higher academic achievement and engagement scores (cognitive, behavioral, emotional and social) than the control group. Moreover, the experimental group had a high level of technology acceptance for IVR usage in classrooms. Our study provides empirical evidence for IVR's use in science education. Furthermore, it also sheds light on how to develop and implement an IVR‚Äêbased classroom for formal educational purposes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Journal

Many scholars have attempted to import technology into the classroom to help students learn in different subjects. However, students often need assistance with unfamiliar learning approaches and learning environments. This study proposed a non‚Äêimmersive virtual reality (VR) guidance system combined with a two‚Äêtier strategy to help students learn geology knowledge. Two groups of students used different learning approaches: the experimental group students were guided by the two‚Äêtier test VR guidance system, and the control group students learned with the conventional VR guidance system. According to the experimental result, the two‚Äêtier test VR guidance system not only improved the students' learning achievement in natural science, but also enhanced their learning motivation. In addition, according to the sequential results, we found that VR learning materials or environmental resources can help students answer questions and solve problems more effectively.

129,Effects of dental students' training using immersive virtual reality technology for home dental practice.,2019,7,,6,Educational Gerontology,"Observation training of home dental practice is easily influenced by the site and time, and differences in learning content are likely to occur among students. The aim of the present study is to prototype virtual reality (VR) teaching material for home dental practice to provide dental students with the chance to observe patients receiving home dental care. The VR teaching material was created before the study, using a patient's home as the medical treatment scene, and practical training was then conducted using this VR teaching material with dental students. To examine its educational effectiveness, 101 dental students, who attended practical training between June 2018 and January 2019, responded to survey questions before and after watching the VR teaching material. They took a comparative examination, based on the questionnaire results, using text mining and hierarchical cluster analysis. Two variables were tested: changes in self-confidence regarding knowledge of home dental practice (knowledge confidence) and changes in self-confidence regarding treatment assistance (assistance confidence). There was a significant increase in student's knowledge confidence and assistance confidence scores (p <.001). Moreover, hierarchical cluster analysis indicated a change in the cluster before and after they watched the VR teaching material. Given that VR teaching material makes it possible to conduct home observation training for a variety of reasons, such as lack of available facilities or patient reservation issues, the findings indicate that VR teaching material can supplement dental students' training in home dental practice.

131,Effects of virtual presence and learning outcome using low-end virtual reality systems.,2019,3,Virtual realityLearningLow-endPresenceSimulator sickness,64,Displays,"‚Ä¢ We study how Low-end VR systems affect the learning outcome. ‚Ä¢ Three VR configurations with different level of immersion were used. ‚Ä¢ We evaluate the effects of virtual presence and learning outcome. ‚Ä¢ The influence of Simulator Sickness was studied. ‚Ä¢ Results indicate that Low-end VR systems produce a learning outcome comparable to High-end VR systems. Low-cost technology is essential to integrate Virtual Reality (VR) into educative institutions around the world. However, low-cost technology usually refers to low-end technology, which may compromise the level of immersion of the VR system. This study evaluates whether low-end and high-end VR systems achieve a comparable learning outcome regardless their immersion level. We also analyze the relationship between virtual presence and the learning outcome arising from a VR educational experience. An evaluation with 42 participants was conducted. We measured learning outcome and virtual presence under three different configurations, namely: a desktop computer, a low-end VR system, and a high-end VR system. The impact of simulator sickness was also analyzed. Results revealed a lower learning outcome in the less immersive configuration (i.e. desktop) and a similar learning outcome in both low-end and high-end VR systems. Even though low-end VR systems are less immersive and produce a lower level of virtual presence than high-end VR systems, the results support the use of low-end VR systems for educative applications.

This study conducted empirical experiments to quantifying the effectiveness of immersive virtual-reality-based safety training (IVST) across 6 worker specialties in terms of facing 17 hazardous scenarios at real construction sites. An immersive virtual reality‚Äìbased safety training system (IVSTS) is proposed to measure the effectiveness of IVST programs with regard to six specialties in 2 controlled groups: (1) novice workers (40 college students), and (2) experienced workers (40 randomly selected construction practitioners). The study results indicate that the proposed IVSTS improved the safety performance index of all 80 participants by 14.12% in terms of correct selection of personal protection equipment, and by 28.95% in terms of hazardous scenario identification. The improvement of safety learning performance of the novice workers was better than that of the experienced workers, especially for hazardous scenario identification, with a 15.90% higher improvement index. The improvement suggestions for the existing IVST program were summarized according to the influence of the individual characteristics of the trainees on the learning effect between the novice and the experienced IVST programs.

The application of the fully immersive virtual 3D environment of Wieng Yong House was developed to support the virtual realitybased learning in the context of museums for culture heritage. To verify the hypothesis, the control group (traditional text-based learning), consisted of 14 students, used the course module of metadata for culture heritage in the museum whereas the experimental group (control group), consisted of 14 students, was provided virtual reality-based learning in the virtual museum. The tools of measurement were the pre-test/post-test quiz for learning competency and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) with interview. The statistical model of paired sampled t-test assumptions was chosen for the statistical investigation for the hypothesis. The results suggest that constructing a virtual reality for learning in the context of a museum for cultural heritage might be a good way to enhance intrinsic motivation but cannot sufficiently and significantly improve the student's learning competency.

VR provides visualisation and interaction within a virtual world that closely resembles a real world, bringing an immersive study experience. It also has two special features: representational fidelity and immediacy of control. However, only when the technology fits the tasks that users are performing will it be adopted. In addition, technology itself cannot improve learning outcomes; certain learning behaviours, such as reflective thinking, should be prompted first so that learning outcomes can be improved. The research hypotheses derived from this model have empirically been validated using the responses to a survey among 180 users. These responses have been examined through SmartPLS 2.0. Surprisingly, task‚Äìtechnology fit does not moderate the relationship between VR and technology quality and the relationship between VR and technology accessibility. From this study, we can conclude that VR will influence reflective thinking and further indirectly improve perceived learning effectiveness. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",Journal

The purpose of this paper is to discuss how we can construct immersive spatial narratives through multimedia-enhanced learning approaches, to increase deeper learner immersion and levels of creativity to transport the learner into a simulated 2030 landscape by reducing the distance between the projected reality and the Self. Design/methodology/approach: The author designed a foresight-based course on the Future of Mobile Learning underpinned by a new learning system that embraced the concept of immersive spatial narratives, combining physical, virtual and cognitive learning spaces, which enable students to explore complex, undiscovered or unstructured knowledge. Practicing was carried out on 35 students who had completed the course during the preceding three years through a questionnaire and interviews to establish increased levels of creativity in a simulated future landscape. Findings: The paper established that the addition of multimedia learning environments and tools to foresight-based learning creates immersive spatial narratives that increase creativity and learner ability to project him/herself into a simulated future landscape. In all, 75 per cent of the respondents stated that having to think about the future and place themselves in a practicing landscape increased their creative skills. Originality/value: A new, foresight-based learning system driven by the concept of immersive spatial narratives, enhanced with student-created multimedia learning tools. The system demonstrated how this approach helps to increase learner creativity and the ability to transition from their Present Self to their Future Self. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Journal

A mixed‚Äêmethod approach was used to obtain an overall understanding of students' experiences with this immersive technology in an elementary classroom. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 27 elementary‚Äêschool students through presence surveys and reflection papers. Statistical analyses were performed to compare immersive VFTs with traditional VFTs regarding students' virtual presence. Further, an inductive content analysis was performed to analyze reflection papers. The results showed an overall enhancement in virtual presence with the use of immersive VFTs. However, students felt that learning was not favorable with HMDs. The result of this study provides practical implications for the use of immersive VFTs in classroom settings.

Little objective data exists supporting its use in teaching clinical anatomy. Learner motivation is thought to limit the rate of utilization of such novel technologies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, satisfaction, and motivation associated with immersive VR simulation in teaching medical students neuroanatomy. Methods Images of normal cerebral anatomy were reconstructed from human Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) computed tomography (CT) imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into 3D VR formats compatible with the Oculus Rift VR System, a head-mounted display with tracking capabilities allowing for an immersive VR experience. The ventricular system and cerebral vasculature were highlighted and labeled to create a focused interactive model. We conducted a randomized controlled study with 66 medical students (33 in both the control and experimental groups). Pertinent neuroanatomical structures were studied using either online textbooks or the VR interactive model, respectively. We then evaluated the students' anatomy knowledge, educational experience, and motivation (using the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey [IMMS], a previously validated assessment). Results There was no significant difference in anatomy knowledge between the 2 groups on preintervention, postintervention, or retention quizzes. The VR group found the learning experience to be significantly more engaging, enjoyable, and useful (all p < 0.01) and scored significantly higher on the motivation assessment ( p < 0.01). Conclusion Immersive VR educational tools awarded a more positive learner experience and enhanced student motivation. However, the technology was equally as effective as the traditional text books in teaching neuroanatomy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Journal

Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered to analyse learning status and, the fluctuation among sessions concerning behaviours, attitudes, reactions. Data were collected from video recordings, myVOR logs, interviews, and an information exam. The results indicated that myVOR was sufficient to teach concepts and complex procedures. However, the learners experienced problems before adapting the used technology, and this affected their behaviours and attitudes during training.

In our 2 √ó 2 between‚Äêsubject design study, we investigated the beneficial effects of adequate sequencing of text and picture and prompting, as well as their potential synergic effect in an immersive virtual reality (VR) learning environment with N = 81 learners. We presented the learning content in form of one pictorial and one textual representation and varied their presentation sequence: pictorial followed by textual representation or textual followed by pictorial representation. As the pictorial representation, we used a VR animation displaying a service robot. As the textual representation, we chose an auditory text about robotics. Additionally, we varied whether or not learners received an elaboration prompt before the learning unit started. We measured learning outcome differentiated for knowledge, comprehension, and application levels. We found beneficial effects for VR animation followed by auditory text on the knowledge level, only. Prompting led to a beneficial effect only on the application level. We found no synergic effect of adequate sequencing and prompting on learning outcome. Hence, depending on the level of learning outcome targeted, different support approaches are advisable. Future research might consider the long‚Äêterm effects of adequate sequencing and prompting or different approaches to measuring mental models. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic? Learning in Virtual Reality (VR) is a promising approach to present the learning material but does not per se guarantee deep learning and the development of a correct mental model.Prior findings imply that presenting pictorial representations first fosters mental model development.Beneficial effects of stimulating learners by an elaboration prompt before learning in virtual reality have been reported.Previous studies imply that instructional design and activation of learners might have synergetic, beneficial effects on learning outcome.What this paper adds We investigated the effects of sequencing order (VR animation or auditory text first) and prompting (with or without) on different levels of learning outcome.We found beneficial effects on the knowledge level when VR animation was presented first, while prompting fostered the application level.No synergetic effects of VR animation first and prompting were found as both support approaches seem to impact different levels of learning outcome.Implications for practice and/or policy Depending on the level of learning outcome that should be fostered while learning in VR, different support approaches are advisable.Presenting a VR animation first fosters learning of basic concepts and definitions at the knowledge level.Using an elaboration prompt before learning in VR enables the learners to process the content deeply.Presenting VR animations first can serve as a brief scaffold for the mental models and additional details can be added in the further learning process.

140,Immersive VR for Organic Chemistry: Impacts on Performance and Grades for First-Generation and Continuing-Generation University Students.,2021,4,Chemistry education; Educational technology; Immersive virtual reality; STEM education; Virtual reality,8,Innovative Higher Education,"Rapid advances in the quality and accessibility of immersive virtual reality (IVR) have brought about intense interest in applications of the technology within higher education, including STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) teaching and learning. However, evidence is mixed on the effectiveness of IVR for STEM teaching and learning, and there are currently few models of how best to incorporate these activities into typical STEM courses. We created a sequence of IVR activities for teaching concepts in organic chemistry and carried out an experimental investigation on the impacts of these on student performance, with special focus on student characteristics including first-generation college student status, gender, and ethnicity. Two sections of Organic Chemistry were compared; in one randomly assigned section, students had the option of completing these IVR activities, and in the other, they did not. Results showed a trend towards improved course grades and final exam scores in the section offered IVR activities, particularly for first-generation college students. These findings suggest that IVR can be a practical and effective way to reinforce learning and student success in realistic university STEM settings, especially for certain demographic subgroups.

141,ImmerTai: Immersive Motion Learning in VR Environments.,2019,7,Immersive education; Motion training; VR education,43,Journal of Visual Communication & Image Representation,"Highlights ‚Ä¢ We designed and implemented the ImmerTai system for immersive Taichi learning. ‚Ä¢ We established a Taichi motion dataset consisting of 150 captured motion. ‚Ä¢ We developed and evaluated a set of motion quality assessment methods. ‚Ä¢ We objectively evaluated ImmerTai in CAVE, HMD, and PC environments. ‚Ä¢ We studied and analyzed the user experience according to key VR factors. Abstract Immersive learning in Virtual Reality (VR) environments is the developing trend for future education systems including remote physical training. This paper presents ""ImmerTai"", a system that is designed for effective remote motion training, particularly for Chinese Taichi, in an immersive way. With ImmerTai, the Taichi expert's motion is captured and delivered to remote students in CAVE, HMD and PC environments for learning. The students' motions are also captured for motion quality assessment and a group of students can form a virtual collaborative learning scenario. We built up a Taichi motion dataset with ground truth of motion quality, and based on this, we developed and evaluated several motion quality assessment methods. Then, user tests were designed and carried out to measure and compare the learning outcomes (learning time, quality and overall efficiency) of students in Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE), Head Mounted Display (HMD) and Personal Computer (PC) environments. Meanwhile, the connections between students' learning outcomes and their VR experience were investigated and discussed too. Our results show that ImmerTai can accelerate the learning process of students noticeably (up to 17%) compared to non-immersive learning with the conventional PC setup. However, we observed a substantial difference in the quality of the learnt motion between CAVE (26% gain) and HMD (23% drop) compared to PC (baseline). While strong VR presence can enhance the learning experience of students, their learning outcomes are not fully consistent to their experience. Overall, ImmerTai with CAVE demonstrated a significantly higher learning efficiency than other tested environments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Journal
142,Impact of immersing university and high school students in educational linear narratives using virtual reality technology.,2020,2,Augmented and virtual reality; Secondary education; Post-secondary education,56,Computers & Education,"Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) is in its early days of educational adoption. This research aims to explain the benefits of VR in transforming learning and student experiences in classrooms. The experiment involved students using an educational VR experience that features an immersive narrative that puts students in the centre of a historical moment in World War Two. Two separate studies were conducted. One with high school students in Australia who would normally be studying the topic. And the other, University students in India, with no prior knowledge or awareness of the topic. Student participants used one of two different versions of Kokoda VR; six-degrees of freedom virtual reality or 360¬∞ video. Both the university and high school students using the virtual reality condition reported higher engagement, presence, empathy and better knowledge mastery than the 360¬∞ video groups. These features were also slightly higher in the university student group than in the high school student group except for the knowledge mastery where the high school students performed better. These findings indicate there is potential for immersive narrative VR experiences to provide students with new experiences and provide both cognitive and affective benefits. ‚Ä¢ Immersive VR can increase cognitive and affective outcomes in student learning. ‚Ä¢ Higher affective scores for university students when using immersive VR. ‚Ä¢ Higher test scores for high school students due to deeper perception experience. ‚Ä¢ Higher affective and cognitive scores for immersive VR compared to 360¬∞ video.

143,Implementing and evaluating novel safety training methods for construction sector workers: Results of a randomized controlled trial.,2020,11,Virtual reality; Human factors safety training; Safety self-efficacy; Safety locus of control; Safety motivation,36,Journal of Safety Research,"‚Ä¢ VR-based safety training has potential to increase safety competencies. ‚Ä¢ VR-based training offers an effective method for boosting safety self-efÔ¨Åcacy. ‚Ä¢ Even small technical issues may inÔ¨Çuence outcomes related to VR-based safety training. ‚Ä¢ The broader form of Human Factors safety training should be evaluated in the future. Introduction: The construction industry is regarded as one of the most unsafe occupational fields worldwide. Despite general agreement that safety training is an important factor in preventing accidents in the construction sector, more studies are needed to identify effective training methods. To address the current research gap, this study evaluated the impact of novel, participatory safety training methods on construction workers' safety competencies. Specifically, we assessed the efficacy of an immersive virtual reality (VR)-based safety training program and a participatory human factors safety training program (HFST) in construction industry workplaces. Method: In 2019, 119 construction sector workers from eight workplaces participated in a randomized controlled trial conducted in Finland. All the study participants were assessed using questionnaires at baseline, immediately after the intervention and at one-month follow-up. We applied generalized linear mixed modeling for statistical analysis. Results: Compared to lecture-based safety training, VR-based safety training showed a stronger impact on safety motivation, self-efficacy and safety-related outcome expectancies. In addition, the construction sector workers who participated in the VR-based safety training showed a greater increase in self-reported safety performance at one-month follow-up. Contrary to our study hypotheses, we found no significant differences between the study outcomes in terms of study participants in the HFST training condition and the comparison condition without HFST training. Conclusion: Our study indicates that VR technology as a safety training tool has potential to increase safety competencies and foster motivational change in terms of the safety performance of construction sector workers. In the future, the efficacy of participatory human factors safety training should be studied further using a version that targets both managerial and employee levels and is implemented in a longer format. Practical implications: Safety training in virtual reality provides a promising alternative to passive learning methods. Its motivating effect complements other safety training activities.

144,Instructional mechanisms in immersive virtual reality serious games: Earthquake emergency training for children.,2021,5,emergency training for children; feedback; instruction; instructional methods; problem-based gaming,22,Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,"Children are vulnerable in earthquakes, but they are also essential to foster earthquake‚Äêresilient communities. It is critical to enhance the preparedness of children against earthquakes through effective education and training. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) and serious games (SGs) are innovative digital technologies that enable realistic and engaging training environments. However, little research has been made on the applications of IVR SGs for earthquake training targeting children. In order to fill this gap, this paper presents an IVR SG training system based on a problem‚Äêbased gaming framework. Three instructional mechanisms within the training system, namely prior instruction, immediate feedback, and post‚Äêgame assessment, were investigated to promote learning through effective reflection. A controlled experiment involving 125 secondary school students aged from 11 to 15 years old was undertaken, using leaflets as a traditional training approach for the control group and the IVR SG training system as the main intervention. Results revealed that the IVR SG training system with post‚Äêgame assessment was the most effective way to train children, with greater knowledge acquisition and self‚Äêefficacy improvement observed. Possible improvements, such as increasing the time for reflection and differentiating the stimulation between positive and negative feedback, are suggested for further research. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: IVR SGs have potentials to train people in emergency behavioural responses, corresponding to problem‚Äêbased learning principles.Instructional mechanisms including immediate feedback, post‚Äêgame assessment, and prior instruction have been applied in IVR SGs in the literature. What this paper adds?: The present paper examines the pedagogical impacts of the three instructional mechanisms within IVR SGs.The present paper investigates the effectiveness of IVR SG‚Äêbased earthquake emergency training, targeting children. Implications for practice and/or policy: IVR SGs with the three instructional mechanisms effectively improve the self‚Äêefficacy of children in the case of dealing with earthquake emergencies.IVR SGs with prior instruction and post‚Äêgame assessment facilitate learning, manifesting in significant knowledge gain after training.IVR SGs have the potential to train children in earthquake emergency responses.

145,Integrating interactive learner-immersed video-based virtual reality into learning and teaching of physical geography.,2020,4,Design and implements; Educational potential; Geography educations; Immersive virtual reality; Learning and teachings; Real world environments; Secondary schools; Technological innovation,48,British Journal of Educational Technology,"Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is regarded as one of the contemporary technological innovations with rich educational potential. As a subset of IVR, spherical video‚Äêbased IVR (SV‚ÄêIVR) immerses users centrally in a human‚Äêrecorded real‚Äêworld environment, allowing them to explore the environment in any directions via mobile phones and cardboard goggles. We have proposed a pedagogical framework‚ÄîLearner‚ÄêImmersed Virtual Interactive Expedition (LIVIE), which leverages SV‚ÄêIVR to integrate immersive and interactive virtual inquiry‚Äêbased fieldwork into learning and teaching of physical geography. Besides discussing the design of LIVIE, this paper reports on the quasi‚Äêexperimental study that we carried out to evaluate its pedagogical effectiveness. The research subjects were 566 students from upper, middle and lower academic‚Äêcategory secondary schools in Hong Kong. The study showed that LIVIE had different degrees of positive effects on the high, moderate and low academic‚Äêachieving subjects. Our work not only provides evidence for supporting wider adoption of LIVIE in geography education, but it also sheds light on how to design and implement the pedagogical use of SV‚ÄêIVR in school education.

146,Investigating Engagement and Flow with a Placed-Based Immersive Virtual Reality Game.,2021,4,Engagement; Flow; Learning game; Place-based; Virtual reality,24,Journal of Science Education & Technology,"An immersive virtual reality (iVR) game for high school students to learn about locations in their watershed with a primary focus on their city was designed and developed, employing a design model that focuses on flow. An exploratory study with the iVR game was conducted in an urban school in the eastern USA with 57 adolescents ages 16‚Äì18 from a population that is economically disadvantaged and includes students who are typically unengaged in traditional school-based learning environments. After game completion, the participants completed a 10-item survey measuring elements of flow and a 12-item survey designed to measure perceptions toward learning with VR games, immersion and presence. Participant focus groups were conducted with an emphasis on features that promoted engagement, learning, immersion, and presence. The findings revealed that all students experienced a flow state when they played the iVR learning game. Almost all users (98.1%) had positive attitudes towards using the iVR game. Students experienced high immersion and presence. In addition, students had favorable attitudes towards learning with iVR games in school environments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Journal
147,Learning experience design with immersive virtual reality in physics education.,2021,3,Immersive virtual reality (VR); Inquiry-based learning; Learning environments; Learning experience (LX) design; Physics education; Technology-enhanced learning,9,Educational Technology Research & Development,"Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) simulations are argued to support students' learning of complex scientific phenomena via the use of realistic graphics and interactions that students can hardly experience in everyday life. However, the integration of immersive VR simulations in science classrooms introduces new challenges, whilst there is a lack of learning designs to inform practice. As part of this study, we firstly present a learning experience (LX) design seeking to introduce an immersive VR simulation in Physics classrooms to support high-school students' understanding of the Special Theory of Relativity. Then, we present an empirical investigation on the enactment and evaluation of the proposed LX design, with 109 high-school students (10‚Äì11th graders). A mixed-method approach was adopted to evaluate students' conceptual learning gains along with their perceptions of the learning experience, encompassing the immersive VR simulation and the inquiry-based learning process adopted. We reflect on our LX design aimed at the integration of an immersive VR simulation in an inquiry-based learning environment and we highlight questions for further research.

148,"Motivation, engagement, and performance across multiple virtual reality sessions and levels of immersion.",2021,4,engagement; immersion; motivation; novelty effect; STEM education; virtual reality,32,Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,"This study investigated changes in learners' motivation, engagement, performance, and spatial reasoning over time and across different levels of virtual reality (VR) immersion. Undergraduate participants explored a virtual solar system via a moderately immersive or highly immersive VR platform over three sessions. In a third condition, participants initially learned with moderate immersion and transitioned to higher immersion after the second session. Following research on novelty effects, we explored whether subjective experiences and performance would decline over time (e.g., decreasing motivation or performance) as participants became familiar with the virtual environment and tools. However, we hypothesized that transitional immersion (i.e., switching from moderate to higher immersion) might lead to a renewed sense of novelty. Results suggested that both moderate and higher levels of immersion were motivating, engaging, and supportive of learning. In contrast to predictions based on novelty effects, these outcomes did not decline overall as learners gained familiarity with the systems. However, transitional immersion emerged as a promising and testable pedagogical approach for future VR education. All participants also showed gains in spatial reasoning. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: Virtual reality can support motivation and learning in STEM education.Novelty may elicit motivation, engagement and learning.Virtual reality may benefit development of spatial reasoning skills. What this paper adds?: Motivation, engagement and performance persist across multiple sessions of VR learning.Switching from moderate to higher immersion increases motivation and engagement.Both moderate and higher immersion support improvements in spatial reasoning. Implications for practice and/or policy: Novelty effects are not a significant concern when implementing VR education over multiple sessions.More immersive VR tools may be progressively introduced during learning.

149,OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE PRE-TREATMENT EDUCATION FOR CAREGIVERS USING VIRTUAL REALITY.,2022,,,,Oncology Nursing Forum,"Educating patients and their caregivers before oncology treatment commences is an accepted standard of care that typically consists of in-person oral and written information. However, caregivers may have different learning requirements in which they may benefit from an additional educational approach. Virtual reality (VR) could be an innovative educational modality to complement the delivery of standard pre-treatment information by offering an immersive experience. The purpose of this study was to describe caregivers' pre-treatment oncology education experiences and whether the addition of visual aids could improve their experiences. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted to guide the future development of a VR experience for caregivers. Participants responded to anonymous demographic and qualitative surveys posted on social media sites. These open-ended surveys were designed to elicit caregivers' experiences receiving pre-treatment education and whether visual aids, described as a video or model, could complement and enhance standard education. Demographic data were calculated using descriptive analyses and qualitative data were analyzed using an inductive coding approach. Participants (N=12) were mostly female (n=10, 83%), white (n=9, 75%), married (n=10, 83%), and well-educated (n=8, 67%). They categorically ranged in age from 26 years to above 65 years. Types of pre-treatment education received were in-person, oral, and written information. One participant received an immersive VR experience to complement pre-treatment preparation. Participants responded that visual aids could improve their experience receiving pre-treatment education by facilitating a better understanding of various procedures, creating a reduction of paperwork, and assisting them with the organization of information. The types of pre-treatment education caregivers received, such as in-person oral and written information, were congruent with standards of pre-treatment care. However, caregivers expressed a visual component could improve their ability to comprehend and organize information. This finding highlights the need to test different visual modalities that could better prepare and provide an enhanced experience for caregivers. VR could be an innovative visual aid immersing both patients and caregivers in the treatment environment. Incorporating different forms of visual technology could offer a robust and enhanced approach to standard pre-treatment education. In alignment with ONS' strategic priorities, exploring caregivers' pre-treatment experiences leads to opportunities to cultivate a spirit of inquiry in which VR could transform how educational content is delivered and reinforced.

150,Process and Outcome-based Evaluation between Virtual Reality-driven and Traditional Construction Safety Training.,2022,6,Construction safety; Embodied cognition; Safety training; Virtual reality; Immersive technology; Hazard recognition,3,Advanced Engineering Informatics,"‚Ä¢ The study investigated the effectiveness of VR-driven immersive safety training. ‚Ä¢ Both process and outcome-based data were collected for empirical analyses. ‚Ä¢ VR-based training outperformed the traditional safety training. ‚Ä¢ Embodied cognition theory was applied in the VR-based safety training. ‚Ä¢ VR-based education motivates individual trainees through multiple bodily sensory engagements. The emerging digital technologies such as virtual reality (VR) provide an alternative platform for construction safety training. In order to explore how digital-driven technologies affect the effectiveness of safety training, there is a need to empirically test the differences in performance between digital 3D/VR safety training and traditional 2D/paper approach. This research conducted a performance evaluation that emphasises both the training process and learning outcomes of trainees based on researchers' self-developed immersive construction safety training platform. Data related to physiological indicators such as skin resistance were collected to measure safety performance before and after the training. The detailed measurement indicators included nine categories (e.g., immersion, inspiration) to form a holistic list of evaluation dimensions. The findings revealed that VR-driven immersive safety training outperformed the traditional way for trainees in terms of both process and outcome-based indicators. Results confirmed that safety training was no longer constrained by understanding or memorizing 2D information (texts and images). Instead, trainees experienced a stronger sense of embodied cognition through the immersive experience and multi-sensory engagement by interacting with the VR-driven system. By engaging the theory of embodied cognition, this research provides both the empirical evidence and in-depth analysis of how immersive virtual safety training outperforms traditional training in terms of both training process and outcomes.

151,Prototyping and Validating a Non-immersive Virtual Reality Serious Game for Healthcare Fire Safety Training.,2021,4,Fire safety; Hospital; Intrinsic motivation; Knowledge; Self-efficacy; Virtual reality,21,Fire Technology,"In a healthcare context, the success of a fire safety procedure in a real-life emergency mainly depends on staff decisions and actions. One of the factors influencing staff decision-making is their training. In most healthcare facilities, safety educators use slide-based lectures as a training tool. Virtual Reality (VR) is gaining fire safety community attention for being an interesting training tool. However, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of VR-based fire safety training simulators compared with a slide-based lecture. The present research proposes a novel non-immersive VR-based training for healthcare fire safety education. This paper describes the prototyping steps required to develop a non-immersive VR serious game (SG) to train the staff of Vincent Van Gogh (VVG) hospital in Belgium. The paper finally validates the VR SG comparing its effectiveness against slide-based lecture training. 78 staff from VVG hospital in Belgium participated in this study. They were divided into two groups: Group A was trained using a slide-based lecture, and Group B was trained using the VR SG. The results indicated that the VR SG was more effective than the slide-based lecture in terms of knowledge acquisition and retention and in terms of self-efficacy increment in short and long terms than the slide-based lecture.

152,Safety knowledge transfer through mobile virtual reality: A study of aviation life preserver donning.,2018,4,Aviation safety; Virtual reality; Mobile devices; Safety education; Safety training,77,Safety Science,"Aviation safety knowledge is a key factor in determining how passengers will respond in an emergency, but the effectiveness of the tools (preflight safety briefing, safety briefing card) used by airlines to educate passengers about safety has been shown to be lacking. This paper explores how one of these tools could be made interactive in order to increase its effectiveness. In particular, we use Virtual Reality (VR) techniques, adapting them to the constraints imposed by on-board aircraft use, such as usage on non-immersive, small displays. As a practical application, the paper examines aviation life preserver donning, which the literature has shown to be particularly difficult for passengers. To evaluate the proposed mobile VR tool, we contrasted it with the traditional safety briefing card in a between-groups study with 68 participants, age 20‚Äì24, focusing on different aspects of effectiveness. The results of the study show that the participants who used the mobile VR tool were able to transfer the presented safety knowledge to the real world, and don an aviation life preserver significantly faster and with fewer errors than participants who used the traditional briefing card. Moreover, these objective results were consistent with subjective ratings by participants; the mobile VR tool was perceived as significantly more engaging, simpler, and more effective than the traditional briefing card. Finally, participants who used the mobile VR tool attained a higher level of self-efficacy. The generalizability of these results would benefit with additional work aimed at an older age cohort that would ostensibly be less familiar with interactive VR technology.

153,Scaffolding in immersive virtual reality environments for learning English: an eye tracking study.,2022,5,English as a Foreign Language; Eye tracking; Scaffolding; Spatial contiguity; Virtual reality,6,Educational Technology Research & Development,"Scaffolding is a mechanism for helping novice learners to solve a problem or complete a task that is beyond their current skill set. Prior research on immersive virtual reality (IVR) environments with scaffolding has mainly focused on the effectiveness of scaffolding for conceptual understanding and information processing. However, research on defining guidelines for designing computer-based scaffolds for IVR is scarce. To fill this gap, some recommendations are provided in this paper on how to design scaffolds for IVR environments for teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL). An eye-tracking study was conducted with N = 41 university students from three EFL courses that used two versions of an IVR application for learning and practicing prepositions of place in English with different scaffolding mechanisms and in different contexts: a context in which the participant can move through the virtual space and a context in which the participant remains seated. A comparative analysis was conducted to determine which scaffolds were more appropriate for learning in IVR. This study extends previous research on scaffolding in IVR environments by suggesting some empirical evidence, collected from eye-tracking, of the effectiveness of different types of scaffolds in IVR environments and some design guidelines are provided. The results showed that scaffolds that are naturally embedded in the IVR environment and are closer to the objects that students need to interact with, are more effective for increasing their learning performance. Practical implications of this study for instructional designers and developers include: scaffolds should be designed considering the spatial contiguity principle and should be naturally blended with the VR environment. Scaffolds should direct students attention to the most important information and scaffolds can be provided in different forms (text, images and on-site indicators). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Journal
154,The Effects of Virtual Reality News on Learning about Climate Change.,2022,8,,7,Mass Communication & Society,"Promoting public knowledge about climate is important for garnering support for climate-change policy, and researchers have begun to study the effectiveness of new technologies as learning tools. News organizations are increasingly producing immersive journalism, including virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), and this study tests whether VR news can be an effective tool for learning about climate change. Based on results from a controlled, in-person laboratory experiment comparing an immersive VR news story to 360¬∞-video and text-with-images versions, we find no main effects on the learning outcomes. However, we do find indirect effects on cognitive elaboration, which are conditional on preexisting knowledge about climate change. Results are discussed in light of their implications for theory about learning in multimedia environments, as well as their implications for the science of science communication.

155,The Effects of Virtual Reality Nonphysical Mental Training on Balance Skills and Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Activity in Healthy Adults.,2022,6,action observation; immersive technology; motor imagery; motor skill; postural control,2,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation,"Context: Athletic skills such as balance are considered physical skills. However, these skills may not just improve by physical training, but also by mental training. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of mental training programs on balance skills and hemodynamic responses of the prefrontal cortex. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: Fifty-seven healthy adults (28 females, 29 males), aged between 18-25 years, participated in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups: virtual reality mental training (VRMT) group, conventional mental training (CMT) group, and control group. The training program included action observation and motor imagery practices with balance exercise videos. The VRMT group trained with a VR head-mounted display, while the CMT group trained with a non-immersive computer screen, for 30 minutes, 3 days per week for 4 weeks. At baseline and after 4 weeks of training, balance was investigated with stabilometry and Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). Balance tests were performed with simultaneous functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) imaging to measure prefrontal cortex oxygenation. Results: For the stabilometry test, at least 1 variable improved significantly in both VRMT and CMT groups but not in the control group. For SEBT, composite reach distance significantly increased in both VRMT and CMT groups but significantly decreased in the control group. For separate directional scores, reach distance was significantly increased in both mental training groups for nondominant leg posterolateral and posteromedial directions, and dominant leg posterolateral direction, while nondominant posteromedial score was significantly increased only in the VRMT group. Between-group comparisons showed that dominant leg posteromedial and posterolateral score improvements were significantly higher than control group for both mental training groups, while nondominant leg improvements were significantly higher than control group only for the VRMT group. The fNIRS oxyhemoglobin levels were not significantly changed during stabilometry tests. However, oxyhemoglobin levels significantly reduced only in the control group during SEBT. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both mental training interventions can significantly improve balance test results. Additionally, VRMT may have some advantages over CMT. These findings are promising for the use of mental training in prevention and rehabilitation for special populations such as athletes and older adults. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Journal
156,The Effects of Virtual Reality Nonphysical Mental Training on Coordination and Skill Transfer in Healthy Adults.,2022,2,postural control; motor skill; motor learning; immersive technology; action observation; motor imagery,1,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation,"Context: Mental training is a promising method to improve motor skills. However, transfer of these improvements to different skills or functional activities is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of mental balance training programs on motor coordination and skill transfer. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: Fifty-seven healthy adults (28 females and 29 males) aged between 18 and 25 years participated in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups: virtual reality (VR) mental training group, conventional mental training group, and control group. The training program included action observation and motor imagery practice with balance exercise videos. The VR mental training group trained with a VR head-mounted display and the conventional mental training group trained with a nonimmersive computer monitor for 30 minutes, 3 days per week, for 4 weeks. Coordination skills were tested with 2 separate custom-made obstacle course tests (OCT-1 and OCT-2). OCT tests included crouching, turning, leaning, stepping over, changing direction, walking on various surfaces, or using repeated hand and arm movement tasks. OCT-1 was used to investigate the effects of mental exercises on coordination skills, and OCT-2 to investigate transfer effects for novel tasks. Test time (total and corrected) and error types (minor, major, and total) were recorded. Touching an obstacle without changing its position was classified as a minor error, and changing its position was a major error. Results: OCT-1 test time and number of errors significantly decreased in the VR mental training and conventional mental training groups, but not in the control group. The number of minor errors was only decreased in the VR mental training group. For OCT-2, total and corrected time were not significantly different between the groups. However, both training groups were significantly superior to the control group for all types of errors. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both training interventions can significantly improve coordination and skill transfer test results. In addition, VR mental training may have some advantages over conventional mental training. These findings are promising for the use of mental training for prevention and rehabilitation in special populations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Journal
157,The moving learner: Object manipulation in virtual reality improves vocabulary learning.,2021,5,embodied cognition; manipulation movement vs. irrelevant movement; second language acquisition; virtual reality,11,Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,"A challenging aspect of foreign language acquisition is learning new vocabulary. Research has demonstrated the benefits of motor action to vocabulary learning, though these findings are rarely translated into teaching and learning practices. In this work, we present a novel paradigm for vocabulary learning in a virtual reality environment, capitalizing on the prominent advantages of this technology as an 'embodied learning' tool. Hebrew‚Äêspeaking adults explored a virtual room and learned the Finnish names of 40 daily objects. Every participant learned the new object names under three conditions: (1) Watch‚Äêonly: watching the object without performing any movement (2) performing an irrelevant movement or (3) performing a manipulation movement that implied its habitual use. Participants completed a word‚Äìpicture matching test after each training block, as well as additional word‚Äìpicture matching and recall tests a week after the initial training session. The overall results demonstrate improved comprehension rates for items that were learned in the manipulation movement condition compared to the irrelevant movement condition, both in the initial learning session and 1 week following it. These initial findings suggest that VR technology may indeed hold the potential to offer a more authentic, multisensory and motor context to efficient foreign language learning. Lay Description: What is currently known about the subject matter: Learning new vocabulary in a foreign language is a challenge to many.Embodied learning, adding meaningful sensory or motor information to learning, has been found to significantly improve memory for new vocabulary.Motor enactment (e.g., hand gestures or object manipulation) is seldom practiced in foreign language courses, as it is very hard to implement in most classroom settings.Virtual reality technology offers a unique opportunity for 'embodied learning,' where the learner can interact and manipulate 3D objects and not just passively view them. What does this paper add to the existing body of research?: We tested the potential contribution of true‚Äêto‚Äêlife motor interaction with objects in a VR setting to vocabulary learning.In a VR environment, participants learned the Finnish names for daily objects in one of three conditions: watching a 3D representation of the object, performing an irrelevant hand gesture while repeating the object's name or interacting with the virtual object and repeating its name.Results indicate that meaningful motor interaction with 3D objects contributed to better long‚Äêterm memory of the new object names, as revealed in both word‚Äìpicture matching and recall tests performed a week after the learning session. Implications of study findings for practitioners: Our findings restate the importance of 'embodied learning': enriching vocabulary learning with sensory and motor information.Specifically, the results suggest that adding relevant motor interaction improves long‚Äêterm learning outcomes more than adding sensory input (like pictures, audio files or videos), even when embedded in an immersive virtual environment.We encourage teachers to incorporate motor enactment in their language learning classes, either in a natural context or using immersive technologies like VR.

158,User Experience of a 3D Interactive Human Anatomy Learning Tool.,2021,4,3D tool; Anatomy; Motor imagery; Spatial ability; User experience; UX,6,Journal of Educational Technology & Society,"Embodiment is particularly relevant for learning anatomy as the knowledge to be acquired is related to the body itself. Several tools using three-dimensional (3D) anatomical structures and avatars (e.g. augmented reality; virtual reality; immersive anatomy; 3D animations) were developed to enrich students' experience by including gestures and body movements into learning anatomy. We developed a new interactive 3D tool that allows personal body experience and enhances spatial representation of musculoskeletal functional anatomy. Students can analyze and recreate a series of movements in real-time 3D interactive settings. This paper shows our research and development approach. Following the development of our anatomy tool, we conducted a pilot and one experiment. The pilot study aimed at evaluating users' experience (UX) of our first prototype. Experiment I aimed at evaluating the UX of the second version of the tool two times in a pretesttraining- posttest design. Students' spatial and motor imagery abilities as well as anatomy examination results were also collected. Our results provided evidence of UX enhancement. Accordingly students appreciated mainly the tool's hedonic (enjoyment) qualities. Overall, significant interactions were observed between students' UX, anatomy scores and motor imagery abilities. Finally, students' mental rotation ability predicted the increase of anatomy score. Cognitive sub-processes underlying functional human anatomy learning as well as students' identification through the avatar are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Journal
159,Using immersive virtual reality to support designing skills in vocational education.,2020,7,Classroom practices; Conventional methods; Design outcomes; Design Quality; Enhanced learning; Immersive virtual reality; Vocational education; Vocational education and training,23,British Journal of Educational Technology,"Immersive virtual reality (IVR) offers possibilities of creating a learner‚Äêcentric environment that can provide more presence and engagement for students leading to an enhanced learning experience compared to conventional classroom practices. However, the potential of IVR in vocational education and training (VET) has not yet been explored in‚Äêdepth, and it is an open question of whether it can effectively support learner creation in a designing task. In this paper, we present an IVR application developed to support gardener apprentices in designing gardens. Using this application, we conducted an experimental study with gardener apprentices to investigate the effect of the IVR interface compared to paper sketching and learner behavior on the proportion, composition, and creativity of the design outcome. Additionally, we investigated how it can be combined with a paper sketching activity to improve its effectiveness. Our analysis shows that the IVR interface can be more effective for the proportion aspect, but this may be limited to students that are able to use it after working with paper. In terms of the combination order, the effectiveness of IVR on the design quality was improved when it was carried out after the paper sketching and this ordering produced a more effective outcome for the proportion and composition aspects. Finally, our results show that IVR design quality is related to learner behaviors such as the time spent on designing and the number of simulations used. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of IVR applications in supporting designing skills and how effectiveness can be improved by combining it with a conventional method of practice.

160,Virtual reality enhances safety training in the maritime industry: An organizational training experiment with a non‚ÄêWEIRD sample.,2022,2,non-WEIRD sample; safety training; simulation; virtual learning; virtual reality,3,Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,"Objective: Many industries struggle with training dynamic risk assessment, and how to bridge the gap between safety training and behavior in real life scenarios. In this article, we focus on dynamic risk assessment during a mooring operation and investigate the potential value of using immersive virtual reality (VR) simulations compared to standard training procedures in an international maritime training organization. Methods: In a pilot study, we compared two ways of implementing a VR simulation (stand‚Äêalone or with post‚Äêsimulation reflection) to a manual and a personal trainer condition in a between‚Äêsubjects design with 86 students in a maritime school. Based on the results we compared the stand‚Äêalone VR simulation to the personal trainer condition in a between‚Äêsubjects design in a non‚ÄêWestern, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) sample of 28 seafarers from the Kiribati Islands at an international maritime training organization. Results: The VR simulation group reported significantly higher perceived enjoyment (d = 1.28), intrinsic motivation (d = 0.96), perceived learning (d = 0.90), and behavioral change (d = 0.88), and significantly lower extraneous cognitive load (d = 0.82) compared to the personal trainer group, but the differences in self‚Äêefficacy, and safety attitudes were not significant. Discussion: The results support the value of using VR to train procedures that are difficult to train in the real world and suggest that VR technologies can be useful for providing just in time training anywhere, anytime, in a global market where employees are increasingly cross‚Äêcultural and dislocated. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Recent meta‚Äêanalyses have found a small effect size benefit to using immersive virtual reality (IVR) learning interventions compared to than less‚Äêimmersive learning approaches.Recent reviews call for more IVR‚Äêbased research that is integrated within actual learning and training interventions.Furthermore, as with most other fields, it is common to use Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) samples for IVR educational and training research purposes. What this paper adds: Evidence that an IVR training intervention can be successfully used in an international maritime training programme with employees from an understudied non‚ÄêWestern population on UN's list of the 50 least developed countries.The finding that IVR‚Äêbased safety training on the topic of dynamic risk assessment during a mooring operation resulted in significantly higher levels of enjoyment, motivation, perceived learning and behavioural change intentions and significantly lower extraneous cognitive load compared to personal trainer instruction.The finding that IVR safety simulation with embedded reflection performed just as well as when an extra post‚Äêsimulation exercise was added to the training intervention. Implications for practice and/or policy: Organizations can benefit from using IVR‚Äêbased safety training methods to increase engagement in dynamic risk assessment.IVR technology can be used broadly with employees from developing countries who have a low level of technology literacy.IVR simulations are effective when they are designed based on state of the art instructional design research and are integrated appropriately into a more general training framework.

161,Virtual reality for developing intercultural communication competence in Mandarin as a Foreign language.,2022,3,Affective domain; Cultural competence; Instructional design; Intercultural communicative competence; Virtual reality,1,Educational Technology Research & Development,"Intercultural communicative competence (ICC) is the ability to interact and communicate appropriately with people from different cultures. The lack of ICC among non-native speakers has resulted in misunderstandings during interactions. Although Malaysia is a multicultural country, there has not been much emphasis in developing ICC in the curriculum. Students in higher education institutions have low levels of ICC. This is also true among students taking Mandarin as a Foreign Language (MFL) in Malaysian polytechnics. Virtual reality (VR) can engage students in the cognitive and affective domains. There is a potential for using VR to improve students' ICC, particularly when students are engaged in producing their own immersive VR environments. Hence, a quasi-experimental research was designed to determine whether utilizing and developing VR environments related to Chinese culture could improve the level of ICC among students. The participants were 31 students enrolled in a MFL course at a polytechnic. The findings indicated a significant increase in the measures of ICC after the implementation and was verified from student feedback through surveys and interviews. VR has the potential for improving ICC levels as it could be used to develop positive attitudes towards another culture. Further studies could be done to investigate whether VR could be used to develop ICC and engage other Malaysian students. ICC is important and needed for cross-cultural collaborations and interactions to promote respect and compassion for other cultures in a community. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Journal
162,"Virtual reality in problem-based learning contexts: Effects on the problem-solving performance, vocabulary acquisition and motivation of English language learners.",2021,3,English learning; motivation; problem-based learning; virtual reality; vocabulary acquisition,27,Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,"Learning a foreign language requires interaction with language input while involved in a task. Given that problem‚Äêbased learning (PBL) offers hands‚Äêon application in realistic contexts, and that virtual reality (VR) enables learners to interact with multiple modalities of information, this study examines how the integration of VR technology into PBL contexts affects students' motivation for, problem‚Äêsolving during, and vocabulary acquisition in learning English as a foreign language (EFL). A total of 84 engineering majors who enrolled in a course of English for specific purposes were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. Students in the experimental group participated in a VR‚Äêassisted PBL context, in which they were to view a PBL scenario using VR technology and then to create VR videos about solving the given problems. Those in the control group participated in a PBL context without the use of VR technology for viewing and solving the identical scenario. After the intervention, all the students wrote a problem‚Äêsolving analysis, took a vocabulary knowledge test, completed a learning motivation questionnaire, and participated in individual interviews. The results showed that the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group in terms of vocabulary acquisition, and were more motivated to learn English related to their future careers, whereas there was no significant difference in the problem‚Äêsolving performance of the two groups. Implications of these findings highlight the value of engaging EFL learners in immersive environments for contextualized learning through the integrated use of VR and PBL. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: Virtual reality (VR) technology has been shown to enhance students' knowledge and skills in STEM fields.Problem‚Äêbased learning (PBL) has been widely used in medical education but not so much in foreign language education.English as a foreign language (EFL) students usually have very limited access to the target language beyond the classroom, thus lack a motivating reason for them to learn English after graduation. What this paper adds?: The VR‚Äêassisted PBL approach proposed in this study was found to significantly enhance the EFL students' specialized vocabulary knowledge.The VR‚Äêassisted PBL approach was found to motivate and sustain the EFL students' interest in career English.Exposing the EFL students to PBL contexts was capable of developing their problem‚Äêsolving performance, regardless of VR integration. Implications for practice and/or policy: The proposed approach has the potential to facilitate student learning in EFL education, particularly English for occupational purposes.EFL educators may apply the VR‚Äêassisted PBL approach to narrow the gap between language classrooms and workplace contexts by immersing students in authentic contexts that were relevant to their occupational knowledge and workplace English.

163,Virtual reality is more efficient in learning human heart anatomy especially for subjects with low baseline knowledge.,2020,8,Virtual reality; Education; Human heart anatomy,36,New Ideas in Psychology,"New technologies make their way into education and one of the most prominent of them is the immersive Virtual Reality (IVR). But the scientific data about its efficiency in the educational process is controversial. In the present study three randomized groups of students, who did not have biological and medical classes amongst their courses, studied human heart anatomy using three different learning methods ‚Äì a paper (text and images); a 3D interactive human heart model presented on a computer display; an IVR human heart model. Prior and after learning session students performed the test of human heart anatomy with 28 open questions. The IVR group showed the increase of correct answers within the group and compared with other groups. Also, the subjects with lesser baseline knowledge in IVR group showed the greater increase of correct answers following IVR session. The structure and the way how the learning material should be presented in IVR and how it affects the learning outcomes are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Journal
164,VR and MR technology for safety management education: An authentic learning approach.,2022,2,Authentic learning; Construction safety; Virtual reality; Mixed reality; Education; Accident investigation,15,Safety Science,"‚Ä¢ VR and MR are successful in operationalising authenticity and groupwork factors. ‚Ä¢ The perceived guidance factor influences the perceived effectiveness of the lesson. ‚Ä¢ The motivation of the students is influenced by the perceived authenticity and groupwork factors. ‚Ä¢ The study derived three proposed guidelines for using VR and MR in safety management education. Effective safety management education is essential for improving safety within the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. While new information technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR) are increasingly explored to improve safety management education and training, they are currently limited by the lack of pedagogies to guide the design and development of learning content. This paper aims to address this issue by utilising the authentic learning framework to guide the design of a VR/MR lesson for safety management education. The study developed an immersive VR/MR simulation-based activity based on the authentic learning framework. The effectiveness of the safety management lesson using an immersive VR/MR simulation is compared to a recorded video lesson. The results showed that the VR/MR simulation is more beneficial to the participants' motivation than the video lesson, but not for knowledge improvement and perceived lesson effectiveness. The results can be attributed to the difficulties in operationalising the guidance factor in the authentic learning framework. The key contributions of this study are threefold: (1) the study demonstrates that the authentic learning framework can be used for guiding the development of VR/MR simulation and recorded video lessons for safety management education; (2) the analysis finds that the VR/MR simulation improves motivation for learning, but not knowledge and perceived effectiveness of the lesson; and (3) three guidelines are suggested to improve the design of VR/MR educational applications.
